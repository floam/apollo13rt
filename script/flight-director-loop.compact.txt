55:46:46             CAPCOM  Okay FLIGHT, you read his pitch and yaw and his high-gain meter.
55:46:50             FLIGHT  That's affirmative.
55:46:51             CAPCOM  And now you want roll right to 060?
55:46:56             FLIGHT  Might as well do that. And we'll try and get Comet Bennett, I'd still like the
                             verification on the docking angle because that's what we'll be using for
                             computation for alignments and everything else. Let's see if there's anything
                             else.
55:47:08              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
55:47:09             FLIGHT  Go ahead, EECOM.
55:47:10              EECOM  Okay, let's terminate the battery B charge at 55 +50.
55:47:14             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:47:15              EECOM  And at the same time, I'd sure like to have a cryo stir, all 4 tanks.
55:47:20             FLIGHT  Let's wait until they get settled down a little more.
55:47:22              EECOM  Roger.
55:47:23                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
55:47:24             FLIGHT  Go, GNC.
55:47:25                GNC  I would still like to enable the other two quads for the maneuver.
55:47:29             FLIGHT  Okay. When rolling to 060 you want them to enable C and D, right?
55:47:35                GNC  Right.
55:47:36             FLIGHT  Do you want them to disable A and B?
55:47:38                GNC  No.
55:47:38             FLIGHT  Okay. All four quads.
55:47:40                GNC  They have coupled jet maneuvers -
55:47:42             FLIGHT  Roger. Copy, CAPCOM?
55:47:44             CAPCOM  Got it.
55:47:46               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
55:47:47             FLIGHT  Go, INCO.
55:47:47               INCO  I'd like to confirm their configuration on their high-gain now.
55:47:50             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:47:51               INCO  I'd like to know what track mode they're in and what SERVO electronics they're
                             in.
55:47:56             FLIGHT  Okay, let's just standby 1 there. Now we'll C and D for roll to 060, terminate
                             battery B charge.
55:48:10             FLIGHT  Okay, the third thing we want up there, CAPCOM, is to verify their high-gain
                             configuration. And I assume what you want from there is you want to know their
                             tracking, position of track - BEAM WIDTH you don't need, do you? Do you want
                             the whole works?
55:48:25               INCO  Yeah, the whole works.
55:48:25             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:48:31             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, we want the configuration of the CSM high-gain.
55:49:34               INCO  That's good.
55:49:35             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:50:05             FLIGHT  Good report.
55:50:09                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
55:50:10             FLIGHT  Go, GNC.
55:50:11                GNC  Can we verify that they reenabled C-4 thruster?
55:50:20             FLIGHT  Okay. Verify that they re- - you're showing that disabled, yes?
55:50:23                GNC  Yes.
55:50:24             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, restore CM C-4 thruster; disabled.
55:50:33              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
55:50:34             FLIGHT  Go EECOM.
55:50:34              EECOM  You've got 40 amp-hours back in battery B now.
55:50:37             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:50:42              EECOM  You got it, FLIGHT.
55:50:43             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:50:54             FLIGHT  Okay, all flight controllers. I want to go around the horn and pick up anything
                             you need configuration-wise. TELMU -
55:51:01              TELMU  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
                     FLIGHT  - you still worried about any configuration items?
55:51:06              TELMU  Negative. The LM heater current indicates that the LM was properly closed out.
                             They apparently have not closed the LM hatch yet.
55:51:14             FLIGHT  Okay. So you're happy that you don't need them to verify that - what was it,
                             activation 2-3, those pages we were on?
55:51:21              TELMU  That's right. That was TLC 2, and we're happy.
55:51:24             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:51:27              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
55:51:29             FLIGHT  Go, GUIDANCE.
55:51:30              GUIDO  Can we ask about the docking index again?
55:51:33             FLIGHT  CAPCOM will get that for me.
55:51:55             FLIGHT  Okay. Got your answer, GUIDANCE?
55:51:57              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT.
55:51:58             FLIGHT  Okay, go with it.
55:52:31             FLIGHT  Okay. GNC, you got any configuration items here?
55:52:35                GNC  Negative, FLIGHT.
55:52:37             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, looks like the last item we need here is a stir on H₂ and O₂ at their
                             convenience.
55:52:44             CAPCOM  Okay.
55:53:56              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
55:53:59             FLIGHT  Go, GUIDANCE.
55:54:00              GUIDO  We finally got a ∆H update. Do you want to just read it up to the crew or
                             uplink it?
55:54:08             FLIGHT  Let's see, now. Can we collapse deadbands and do all that good stuff if we
                             uplink here?
55:54:18              GUIDO  Uh. Yeah. That - why don't we just read it up to them?
55:54:23             FLIGHT  If they enter it through the DSKY are they gonna do it?
55:54:26              GUIDO  Standby 1.
55:54:30             FLIGHT  Now, we haven't stabled out at that attitude yet, so I don't think we're gonna
                             have any problems.
55:54:34                GNC  FLIGHT, I don't think there's any problem, they haven't opened up deadbands yet.
55:54:37             FLIGHT  Yeah, that's just what I'm saying. The time to do it is now, GUIDANCE.
55:54:41              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
55:54:42             FLIGHT  Go, GUIDANCE.
55:54:43              GUIDO  As long as he's in P00 and don't reselect it, he can uplink it - enter it
                             himself or we can do it easier. Doesn't matter.
55:54:57             FLIGHT  Okay. Why don't - you gotta pass the data for the crew checklist anyway
                             on-board, don't you?
55:55:04              GUIDO  Right.
                     FLIGHT  Don't you got a page update? Well, why don't we read it up to them and that'll
                             serve both purposes.
55:55:10              GUIDO  Alright.
55:55:10             FLIGHT  Both have them enter it as well as why don't you tell them what page you want
                             it in the checklist?
55:55:14              GUIDO  Okay.
55:55:18              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
55:55:18             FLIGHT  Go, TELMU.
55:55:19              TELMU  We show the LM overhead hatch is closed, and the heater current looks normal.
55:55:23             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:55:26              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
55:55:27             FLIGHT  Go, GUIDANCE.
55:55:27              GUIDO  We've had a hardware restart. I don't know what it was.
55:55:29             FLIGHT  Okay. GNC, you want to look at it? See if you see any problems?
55:55:37             FLIGHT  Roger. We're copying it, CAPCOM. We see a hardware restart.
55:55:41             FLIGHT  You see an AC BUS UNDERVOLT there, GUIDANCE? Err - EECOM?
55:55:46              EECOM  Negative, FLIGHT.
55:55:48             FLIGHT  I believe the crew reported it.
55:55:50             CAPCOM  We've got a MAIN B UNDERVOLT.
55:55:51              EECOM  Okay, FLIGHT, we've got some instrumentation funnies, let me add them up.
55:55:54             FLIGHT  Roger.
55:56:00              EECOM  We may have had an instrumentation problem, FLIGHT.
55:56:03             FLIGHT  Roger.
55:56:07               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
55:56:08             FLIGHT  Go, INCO.
55:56:09               INCO  We switched to WIDE BEAM width about the time we had the problem.
55:56:33             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:56:42             FLIGHT  INCO, you say you went to WIDE BEAM width there?
55:56:44               INCO  Yes.
55:56:49             FLIGHT  Let's see if we can correlate those times. Get the time when you went WIDE
                             BEAM, INCO.
55:56:55               INCO  Okay.
55:57:02             CAPCOM  Do we have the floodlights off right now?
55:57:04              TELMU  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
55:57:05             FLIGHT  Yeah, we can determine that from the LM current.
55:57:37             FLIGHT  Roger, we copy that also.
55:58:13             FLIGHT  EECOM, you see any AC problems? Looks like -
55:58:15              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
                     FLIGHT  - we have a lot of instrumentation problems here. Go ahead.
55:58:18              EECOM  That's affirm. He's flipping the fuel cells around, FLIGHT.
55:58:23             FLIGHT  Well, let's get some recommendation here, Sy, if you've got any better ideas.
55:58:32             FLIGHT  Sy, what do you want to do? Hold your own, and -
55:58:40             FLIGHT  - Sy, have you got a SIG SENSOR type problem there, or what?
55:58:43              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
55:58:44             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
55:58:45              EECOM  He's got fuel cells 1 and 3 are offline. We've got MAIN A volts, we have no
                             MAIN B volts. Have them attempt to reconnect the fuel cells. FUEL CELL 1 to
                             MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B.
55:59:02             FLIGHT  Okay.
55:59:03              EECOM  We just gotta -
                     FLIGHT  FUEL CELL 1 -
                      EECOM  - back to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 back to MAIN B.
                     FLIGHT  - MAIN A, 3 to MAIN B.
55:59:10              EECOM  Let's see what happens.
55:59:11             FLIGHT  Okay, now is there - do we have instrumentation problems?
55:59:16              EECOM  Well, we've lost - it does appear we've lost AC BUS 2 VOLTAGE. MAIN B is
                             reading - 4 volts. And that effectively takes AC 2 away from us -
55:59:29             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      EECOM  - the - yeah and he reported barber poles on the -
55:59:35             FLIGHT  Roger.
                      EECOM  - on the fuel cell on-board, too, FLIGHT.
55:59:36             FLIGHT  (unintelligible) yeah.
55:59:38                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
55:59:39              EECOM  Let's see if we can get our DC back.
55:59:40             FLIGHT  Roger. Go ahead, GNC.
55:59:41                GNC  Verify that the Quad Delta HELIUM VALVES are open.
55:59:46             FLIGHT  You seeing an attitude problem or you seeing some BI-levels that are giving you
                             problems?
55:59:51                GNC  No, it's some low pressures in the fuel and oxidizer which would be symptomatic
                             of the HELIUM VALVE closing and firing some jets.
55:59:59             FLIGHT  Quad number 2 HELIUM VALVE open?
56:00:01                GNC  Quad Delta.
56:00:02             FLIGHT  Quad Delta - HELIUM VALVE open, right?
56:00:05                GNC  Right.
56:00:10             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, do you want to verify the Quad Delta HELIUM VALVE is open, please.
56:00:16             FLIGHT  Are there other problems in the RCS, Buck?
56:00:20             CAPCOM  Okay, is that all we've come up with for them; have we got any other
                             recommendations?
56:00:25             FLIGHT  Yeah, we wanted to get FUEL CELL 1 configured to MAIN A, FUEL CELL 3 to MAIN B.
                             Did you pass that up?
56:00:32              EECOM  Let's attempt that, FLIGHT.
56:00:37             FLIGHT  INCO, this seems to be an AC type problem, it may be tied into that high-gain
                             thing you got.
56:00:45               INCO  We went to WIDE BEAM with - FLIGHT - at 55:55:04, best we can tell.
56:00:49             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:01:06              EECOM  I copy, FLIGHT.
56:01:09              EECOM  Let me commiserate on that.
56:01:16             CAPCOM  Is there any kind of leads we can give them? Are we looking at instrumentation
                             or have we got a real problem, or what?
56:01:34              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:01:35             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:01:36              EECOM  Let's reverse the configuration request -
56:01:38             FLIGHT  Okay, but wait a minute. We've got a good MAIN A BUS, let's make sure that
                             whatever we do doesn't screw up MAIN A. MAIN A -
56:01:43              EECOM  FUEL CELL 2 is on MAIN A, FLIGHT -
56:01:45             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      EECOM  - and I'm not going to ask to change that.
56:01:47             FLIGHT  Okay, what do you want to do?
56:01:48              EECOM  Let's try to put FUEL CELL 1 on MAIN B, FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A. We'll use the
                             other sensing circuitry.
56:01:57             FLIGHT  FUEL CELL number 1 on MAIN B -
56:02:00              EECOM  - FUEL CELL 3 on MAIN A.
56:02:09              EECOM  We're not going to touch FUEL CELL 2, FLIGHT.
56:02:12             FLIGHT  Okay, but if we got any problems in the system I want to make sure that we
                             don't blow the voltage off MAIN A, then we're not going to be able to see
                             anything.
56:02:28             FLIGHT  Can we review our status here, Sy, and see what we've got from a standpoint of
                             status. What do you think we've got in the spacecraft that's good?
56:02:35              EECOM  MAIN BUS A is reading 25 volts.
56:02:38             FLIGHT  Okay. MAIN A -
56:02:39              EECOM  And that's reflected by the fact - FUEL CELL 2 is putting out 53 amps, which is
                             just about the most it can and keep our voltage up.
56:02:48             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:02:48              EECOM  So that's bona fide. AC BUS 2 is 0, which is reflected by the fact that we lost
                             MAIN B.
56:02:55             FLIGHT  AC BUS -
56:02:59              EECOM  Standby, FLIGHT.
56:03:03             FLIGHT  - zero output.
56:03:07              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:03:13             FLIGHT  Go ahead, EECOM.
56:03:14              EECOM  Okay. If we want to keep - - standby, he's changed configuration, we've got
                             BATTERY A on MAIN A.
56:03:27             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
56:03:27              EECOM  That's what I was going to ask you for, to put the battery on, FLIGHT.
56:03:30               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
56:03:31             FLIGHT  Go, INCO.
56:03:31               INCO  We need OMNI Bravo. Our high-gain won't drive without AC 2.
56:03:37             FLIGHT  Okay. You want OMNI Bravo?
56:03:39               INCO  Right.
56:03:48             FLIGHT  You don't think we're going to be able to get HIGH BIT RATE data here, do you?
                             On the OMNIs.
56:03:53               INCO  We may be. We've got the 210s.
56:03:54             FLIGHT  You've got the 210s -
56:03:56               INCO  Right.
                     FLIGHT  Okay, that'll save a bit of power. CAPCOM, recommend selection of OMNI Bravo,
                             please -
56:04:02               INCO  It's Charlie now.
                     FLIGHT  Okay, Charlie.
56:04:03               INCO  He's maneuvering.
56:04:05             CAPCOM  OMNI Charlie?
56:04:06             FLIGHT  That's affirmative.
56:04:06               INCO  Roger.
56:04:27               INCO  Okay, FLIGHT, we've got OMNI Charlie and HIGH BIT RATE.
56:04:31             FLIGHT  Okay. You have HIGH BIT RATE now off the 210s, right? OMNI -
56:04:34               INCO  Right.
                     FLIGHT  Okay.
56:04:58              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:04:59             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:05:00              EECOM  Okay. Let's get a readout on a couple of fuel cell pressures here -
56:05:04             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      EECOM  - FUEL CELL 1 N₂ pressure. FUEL CELL 3 O₂ pressure. We're reading 0 N₂ pressure
                             on FUEL CELL 1 and 13psi on FUEL CELL 3 O₂ pressure.
56:05:18             FLIGHT  Okay, you want FUEL CELL 1 -
56:05:21              EECOM  N₂ pressure.
                     FLIGHT  - N₂ pressure. FUEL CELL 3, what do you want there?
56:05:26              EECOM  O₂ pressure.
56:05:27             FLIGHT  O₂ pressure. CAPCOM, let's get those as a start.
56:05:33              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
56:05:34             FLIGHT  Go, GUIDANCE.
56:05:35              GUIDO  When his hardware restart he was doing a clearly fine maneuver, and that should
                             have killed it, but we're still moving. We ought to stop it.
56:05:45             FLIGHT  Are we using RCS now, Buck?
56:05:58             FLIGHT  GNC, from FLIGHT.
56:06:02             FLIGHT  GNC, from FLIGHT.
56:06:04                GNC  GNC.
56:06:05             FLIGHT  Did you see any problems in Quad D HELIUM VALVE? Does that look like that's
                             cleared up?
56:06:08                GNC  Roger, that's cleared up, FLIGHT, we're in good shape.
56:06:10             FLIGHT  Okay. Now, are we using RCS now?
56:06:12                GNC  That's affirmative, we're going to have to switch some thrusters to MAIN A to
                             hold attitude here.
56:06:17             FLIGHT  Okay. How much RCS are we using?
56:06:22                GNC  Oh, we've used - our guess 25 pounds.
56:06:27             FLIGHT  Okay. Give me minimum fuel usage configuration that'll keep me attitude.
56:06:32                GNC  Roger.
56:06:33              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
56:06:34             FLIGHT  Go, TELMU.
56:06:35              TELMU  The LM heater current's become essentially static.
56:06:38             FLIGHT  Roger. Let's solve one problem at a time. Come back to me later on on it.
56:07:05             CAPCOM  We confirming those numbers?
56:07:20             FLIGHT  Buck, I need that RCS stuff as soon as you can get it.
56:07:22                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. He's turned off all jets now.
56:07:24             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:07:26             CAPCOM  Okay, we came up with those numbers, FLIGHT.
56:07:29             FLIGHT  Okay, Sy. Give me your next best thing to try.
56:07:46             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:07:47              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:07:48             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
56:07:51              EECOM  Why don't we try - leave FUEL CELL 2 alone, and just make sure that 1 and 3 are
                             disconnected from both buses. And make sure that there's abs - that there won't
                             be any load on them at all. And let's see what happens to those cells.
56:08:06             FLIGHT  Okay, what do you want to do? Open-circuit FUEL CELL 1 and 3?
56:08:09              EECOM  That's affirm, flight.
56:08:10             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, let's recommend we open-circuit FUEL CELL number 1 and number 3
                             and leave FUEL CELL number 2 as-is.
56:08:21             CAPCOM  Okay, 1 and 3 open-circuit, 2 as-is. And earlier we got a report from them that
                             1 and 3 were reading grey but zero flow.
56:08:29             FLIGHT  Yeah - CAPCOM, let's amend that. EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:08:32              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:08:33             FLIGHT  Why don't we just open-circuit 1 and make sure we don't have any problems
                             getting that back onto the bus -
56:08:38              EECOM  Okay, FLIGHT.
                     FLIGHT  - and just watch it for a while before we make any further moves with 3.
56:08:41              EECOM  Roger.
56:08:41             FLIGHT  Okay, CAPCOM. Let's just open-circuit one of those right now.
56:08:57                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:09:05              EECOM  That's roger, FLIGHT. That's the AC problem.
56:09:08             FLIGHT  Roger.
56:09:16             FLIGHT  Crew thinks they're venting something.
56:09:18              EECOM  I heard it, FLIGHT.
56:09:28             CAPCOM  Copy that, FLIGHT?
56:09:29             FLIGHT  Roger.
56:09:33             FLIGHT  Okay, let's everybody think of the kinds of things that we'd be venting. GNC,
                             you got anything that looks abnormal in your system?
56:09:39                GNC  Negative, FLIGHT.
56:09:43             FLIGHT  How about you, EECOM? You see anything that - with the instrumentation you've
                             got that could be venting?
56:09:53              EECOM  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
56:10:01              EECOM  Let me look at the system, FLIGHT, as far as the venting is concerned.
56:10:03             FLIGHT  Okay. Let's start scanning. I assume you've called in your backup EECOMs?
56:10:10             FLIGHT  EECOM?
56:10:11              EECOM  FLIGHT, say again?
56:10:12             FLIGHT  Have you called in your backup EECOMS now? See if we can get some more brain
                             power on this thing?
56:10:15              EECOM  We got one here.
56:10:16             FLIGHT  Roger.
56:10:17               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
56:10:18             FLIGHT  Go, INCO.
56:10:18               INCO  He's - he's - never mind, he's straightening up a little bit.
56:10:21             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:10:46             FLIGHT  Okay, now, let's everybody keep cool. We've got the LM still attached, the LM
                             spacecraft is good, so if we need to get back home we've got a LM to do it
                             with. Okay? Let's make sure we don't do anything that's going to blow our CSM
                             electrical power with the batteries, or that will cause us to lose the MAIN -
                             the FUEL CELL number 2. We want to keep the O₂ and that kind of stuff working,
                             we'd like to have RCS. But we've got the Command Module system, so we're in
                             good shape if we need to get home. Let's solve the problem, but let's not make
                             it any worse by guessin'.
56:11:47                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:11:50             FLIGHT  Go, GNC.
56:11:51                GNC  I have some jet configurations for you whenever you need them.
56:11:54             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:11:57             FLIGHT  Give them to me.
56:12:01                GNC  Okay. Charlie 3, Charlie 4 to MAIN A. Bravo 3 and Bravo 4 to MAIN A. Charlie 1
                             and Charlie 2 to MAIN A -
56:12:13             FLIGHT  Standby.
56:12:21                GNC  Yeah; it's all of quad Charlie on MAIN A.
56:12:24             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:12:25                GNC  Plus Bravo 3 and Bravo 4.
56:12:29             FLIGHT  Now, what are we going to be doing with these, GNC?
56:12:32                GNC  That'll give us one jet in each direction on each axis.
56:12:35             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:12:36              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
56:12:36             FLIGHT  Go, GUIDANCE.
56:12:37              GUIDO  He's getting close to gimbal lock.
56:12:39             FLIGHT  CAPCOM - okay, CAPCOM, recommend he bring up C-3, C-4, B-3, B-4, C-1, C-2 on
                             MAIN A and advise him he's getting close to gimbal lock.
56:12:52             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, from FLIGHT.
56:12:53              GUIDO  Go ahead.
56:12:53             FLIGHT  Could we go to a coarse align on the platform here, so we don't have to use any
                             gas if we need to? We could reorient if necessary.
56:13:02              GUIDO  Roger. I was going to recommend a P52 in a little bit anyway -
56:13:05             FLIGHT  Well, it's going to take a while before we get to the point we're even thinking
                             about a P52.
56:13:09              GUIDO  Yeah.
56:13:12             FLIGHT  Yeah, it'll coarse align itself there, won't it?
56:13:18              GUIDO  It'll coarse align at -
56:13:19             FLIGHT  Roger.
                      GUIDO  - any time itself.
56:14:10             FLIGHT  Okay, EECOM. I'm coming back to you.
56:14:13              EECOM  FLIGHT -
56:14:14             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
                      EECOM  - I think the best thing we can do right now is start a power down.
56:14:19             FLIGHT  Okay -
56:14:20              EECOM  Let's go down the emergency 1-5.
56:14:24             FLIGHT  You want to power down, let us look at the TM and all that good stuff, and then
                             come back up.
56:14:29              EECOM  That's affirm.
56:14:30               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. OMNI Bravo.
56:14:32             FLIGHT  You want OMNI Bravo again?
56:14:34               INCO  Right.
56:14:34             FLIGHT  On board. OMNI Bravo.
56:14:42             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, recommend OMNI Bravo.
56:14:47             FLIGHT  Okay. What - you want to go to - power down - give me the page.
56:14:51              EECOM  Emergency 1-5, FLIGHT, we'll go down - try to get a delta of 10 amps reduction.
56:15:14               INCO  Okay, we've got OMNI Bravo, FLIGHT.
56:15:22             FLIGHT  EECOM, do you want to go through that again? What do you want to power down to?
56:15:25              EECOM  I want to power down a total of 10 amps, FLIGHT.
56:15:28             FLIGHT  A total of 10 amps.
56:15:30              EECOM  That's affirm.
56:15:31             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:15:35             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, we'd recommend emergency power down checklist 1-5, we want to power
                             down a total - a delta of 10 amps from where we are now.
56:15:44                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:15:45             FLIGHT  Go, GNC.
56:15:45                GNC  Can we afford to do a PTC first, and then we can shut off all of that stuff
                             with no problems.
56:15:51             FLIGHT  Why? You think you're going to have a thermal problem here?
56:15:53                GNC  Well, we could have - if we stay there too long, or we -
56:15:56             FLIGHT  Okay, we'll run into that one later, Buck -
56:15:59                GNC  Okay.
                     FLIGHT  - I want to get our major problems sorted out now.
56:16:02             CAPCOM  You want - you still want 1-5 down to 10 amps?
56:16:04             FLIGHT  1-5 power down a delta of 10 amps, CAPCOM.
56:16:32             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:16:34              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
56:16:35             FLIGHT  You don't want to get fuel cell pumps off, do you?
56:16:44             FLIGHT  Optics power is already off, I believe.
56:16:47              EECOM  We can do that on FUEL CELL number 1, FLIGHT.
56:16:50             FLIGHT  Okay, well let's make sure we don't blow the whole mission.
56:17:20              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:17:21             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:17:22              EECOM  Would you not want to consider going to PTC?
56:17:26             FLIGHT  Well, why don't we get this problem here resolved, right now -
56:17:30              EECOM  This will aid our power down, I think -
56:17:32             FLIGHT  Pardon?
                      EECOM  - this should aid our power down, I'd hope - wouldn't it?
56:17:37             FLIGHT  Well, do you expect that we're going to be in a thermal problem for the next
                             many hours? EECOM?
56:17:44              EECOM  Well, don't know where to say the sun is right now, FLIGHT.
56:17:47                GNC  Well, it's pretty close to quad A right now. Are we -
56:17:51              EECOM  By 90 degrees?
56:17:54                GNC  I don't know exactly where. It's between A and B, mostly on A.
56:18:32             FLIGHT  GNC, from FLIGHT.
56:18:37             FLIGHT  GNC, from FLIGHT.
56:18:40                GNC  GNC.
56:18:42             FLIGHT  Buck, I'd prefer not making any unnecessary maneuvers now, or try to use any of
                             the equipment's on board the spacecraft, such things as CMC, that type of stuff
                             until we nail down what our problem is.
56:18:55                GNC  Well, that's why I was recommending PTC because we don't need any of that stuff
                             then; heaters or anything else.
56:18:59             FLIGHT  Yeah, but you gotta get the CMC on, and keep it online. And you need a rather
                             precise period of time for redamping there.
56:19:10                GNC  In the order of about 20 minutes to damp out and spin up and then we don't need
                             any of that.
56:19:18                GNC  If we get a good spinup going then we're stable -
56:19:19             FLIGHT  Okay, that might be a good idea. That would buy us some time from a standpoint
                             of reviewing the data. And it would get us back into the - as close to the
                             normal flight plan as we could. How far are we out of attitude right now?
56:19:38                GNC  He's a fair ways out right now, FLIGHT. He'd do another VERB 49 and fly back
                             and then stabilize there.
56:20:57              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:20:58             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:20:58              EECOM  Okay, I need one thing right now. He's powering down, he's down to 41 amps,
                             total spacecraft. I'd like to get my AC 2 BUS back so I can look at O₂ TANK 2
                             PRESSURE. I have no insight into that.
56:21:12             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:21:13              EECOM  Let's get - I guess we can put INVERTER 3 to MAIN A. AC 2.
56:21:23              EECOM  Let's just do it temporarily -
56:21:23             FLIGHT  Now, let me ask you a question - before you do that would you like to make sure
                             you've got all AC load you don't need isolated from the bus?
56:21:32              EECOM  Nah, it - let's not do that right now, FLIGHT. I think we're in good shape that
                             way. The MAIN A is up high enough where it can handle the inverter.
56:21:40             FLIGHT  Well, the thing that concerns me is starting - is throwing equipment - we had a
                             problem, we don't know the cause of the problem, and -
56:21:46              EECOM  FLIGHT, I've got a feeling we've lost two fuel cells. I hate to put it that
                             way, but - I don't know why we've lost them. It doesn't all tag up. And it's
                             not an instrumentation problem, the best I can tell right now.
56:22:00             FLIGHT  Okay, I'll tell you what. Let's discuss this for just a little bit longer
                             there, Sy. CAPCOM, start them moving back towards a PTC attitude, let's start
                             him going into his rate damping. I feel it's going to be a relatively long
                             period of time to try and nail down the problem. Go ahead.
56:22:14             CAPCOM  He's asking how do we like his amperage setup right now?
56:22:19             FLIGHT  Are you happy with his power level right now, EECOM?
56:22:29               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
56:22:30             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
56:22:31               INCO  I'd like to firmly secure the high-gain before he starts getting into PTC.
56:22:54                GNC  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
56:22:54             CAPCOM  GNC? What's firing now? You got something firing?
56:22:59                GNC  Well, we've seen quite a bit of thruster activity.
56:23:02             FLIGHT  Okay, I guess this kills the PTC, too, because we're not going to get into PTC
                             as long as we've got something venting.
56:23:12                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. That agrees with what we're seeing here.
56:23:15              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:23:16             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:23:17              EECOM  I've got a little correction. Let's put INVERTER 1 on both AC buses, please.
56:23:21             FLIGHT  INVERTER 1 on both AC.
56:23:22              EECOM  That's affirm, so I can get some AC BUS power back so I can have some insight
                             into my AC BUS 2 telemetry, especially my cyros, maybe - the venting may be
                             coming from that. And also, I think that the FUEL CELL 2 pumps are on AC 2, and
                             this will take care of it without switching the pumps yet.
56:23:44             FLIGHT  Say that again. You think your fuel cell pumps -
56:23:47              EECOM  Yeah. FUEL CELL 2 pumps I think are on AC 2.
56:23:50             FLIGHT  Okay, but according to the checklist, he should have powered - he should have
                             turned those off, right? Now, he said he was down through BMAG number 2 is in
                             WARM UP, so he's already gone through the fuel cell pump stuff.
56:24:01              EECOM  Okay. Good enough.
56:24:04             FLIGHT  Okay, so you want to configure INVERTER 1 on both AC buses.
56:24:08              EECOM  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
56:24:21             CAPCOM  FLIGHT, I didn't - I was listening to the spacecraft and I didn't pass up
                             INVERTER 3 to MAIN A to AC 2, did you delete that?
56:24:29             FLIGHT  No, we deleted that.
56:24:31             CAPCOM  Alright.
56:24:35             FLIGHT  You want to put INVERTER 1 on both AC BUSES. EECOM and CAPCOM, let's do it.
56:24:40             CAPCOM  Okay.
56:24:47             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:24:48              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:24:49             FLIGHT  Monitor this bear when we switch again -
56:24:50              EECOM  With you.
56:25:00             FLIGHT  TELMU and CONTROL, from FLIGHT.
56:25:03              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
56:25:04            CONTROL  Go, FLIGHT.
56:25:04             FLIGHT  Will you take a look at the prelaunch data and go through your systems and see
                             if there's anything you've got that may have started venting here?
56:25:09            CONTROL  Roger, FLIGHT.
56:25:10              TELMU  We'll look.
56:25:11             FLIGHT  Okay. And I want a report on that in about the next fifteen minutes. Quick look
                             type stuff.
56:25:15            CONTROL  Okay.
56:25:17                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
56:25:18             FLIGHT  Go, FDO.
56:25:18                FDO  We're definitely seeing a vent in the data.
56:25:20             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:25:28             FLIGHT  Roger. We copy that, CAPCOM.
56:25:37              EECOM  Fuel cell - FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:25:38             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
56:25:39              EECOM  FUEL CELL 2 PUMPS to AC 1.
56:25:41             FLIGHT  You want FUEL CELL 2 PUMP to AC 1.
56:25:44              EECOM  Affirmative.
56:25:45             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FUEL CELL 2 PUMP to AC 1.
56:26:02             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:26:03              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:26:03             FLIGHT  Have you got anybody getting a delog on this thing downstairs?
56:26:09             FLIGHT  NETWORK, from FLIGHT.
56:26:10            NETWORK  FLIGHT, NETWORK.
56:26:11             FLIGHT  Bring me up another computer in the RTCC, will you?
56:26:14            NETWORK  We got one machine on the RTCC and we got dual CPs downstairs.
56:26:19             FLIGHT  Okay, I want another machine up in the RTCC and I want a bunch of guys capable
                             of running delogs down there.
56:26:24            NETWORK  Roger that.
56:26:26             CAPCOM  FLIGHT, did you hear them say he's getting some rates? We want to know if he's
                             firing any thrusters?
56:26:32             FLIGHT  Roger. GNC, watch those thrusters, will you?
56:26:35                GNC  GNC. Say again?
56:26:36             FLIGHT  Have you got any thrusters firing?
56:26:38                GNC  We're looking at that C-3 thruster, FLIGHT. It looks like it stays on most of
                             the time.
56:26:43             FLIGHT  Well, can we turn them all off and see if we've still got the rates or any
                             build-up in rates?
56:26:48                GNC  Well, the rates that we're seeing is opposite to the direction of that
                             thruster, so if anything it's just trying to hold and not quite up to it.
56:26:54             FLIGHT  Okay, but -
56:26:55             CAPCOM  He's been trying to counteract the rates with DIRECT. He's been getting a
                             negative pitch and a negative roll.
56:27:03             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:27:07             CAPCOM  But he asked if we were getting some thruster firings that were not being made
                             by him.
56:27:12             FLIGHT  I'll tell you what, GNC can you get somebody in the back room to try to figure
                             out what the equivalent ∆V is we're getting? So that we can see if we can
                             backtrack to see if we can figure out what's venting.
56:27:30             FLIGHT  In other words, do - it would seem that we could equate that to effective
                             thrust and an axis and then deduce what's venting.
56:27:38                GNC  Roger, we'll give that a try, FLIGHT.
56:27:39             FLIGHT  Okay. And that might be of interest to the LM guys.
56:27:42             CAPCOM  He also said it was coming past window number 1.
56:27:45             FLIGHT  Roger, we got that.
56:27:45               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. Need OMNI Charlie.
56:27:47             FLIGHT  OMNI Charlie, CAPCOM.
56:27:51             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT. What did - okay, we've got two good AC buses. What did all
                             that tell you, now?
56:27:59              EECOM  It tells me that - well, just give me about 2 more minutes, FLIGHT.
56:28:04             FLIGHT  Okay. Take your time.
56:28:48             FLIGHT  Roger. Concur, CAPCOM.
56:28:54              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU. We copy.
56:28:56             FLIGHT  Roger.
56:28:57                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
56:28:58             FLIGHT  Go, FDO.
56:28:59                FDO  Two machines in the RTCC.
56:29:00             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:31:38                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:31:39             FLIGHT  Go, GNC.
56:31:40                GNC  We would like to turn thruster Alpha 3 on MAIN A and see that'll help control
                             that pitch and at the same time we can turn off Charlie 3 because -
56:31:47             FLIGHT  Okay. Get me some real-time plotting on how we're using RCS here, will you?
56:31:51                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. And in the pitch axis we really don't seem to be using any. And
                             that's why we'd like to go to Alpha and see if that changes it any.
56:31:58             FLIGHT  Okay, now what do you want again?
56:32:00                GNC  Thruster Alpha 3 to MAIN A.
56:32:06             FLIGHT  Alpha 3 to MAIN A.
56:32:10             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, do you want to pass that up to the crew, please?
56:32:18             FLIGHT  Give me a gross amount of RCS propellant consumed so far, GNC.
56:32:25                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. It'll take 30 seconds.
56:32:26             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:32:31                GNC  That's affirmative, FLIGHT. We're still below the limits.
56:32:34              EECOM  Flight, EECOM.
56:32:35             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:32:37              EECOM  We've really got to get that battery off the line and power down some more. And
                             we've got to get some MAIN B power back so we can build our pressure back up in
                             O₂ TANK 1. It's down to 318psi.
56:32:52             FLIGHT  BATTERY -
                      EECOM  With MAIN B down, we have no heaters in O₂ tanks.
56:32:56             FLIGHT  Okay, what do you want to power down?
56:32:58              EECOM  Well, where'd he say he got down to? BMAG 2 OFF? Not inclusive?
56:33:03             FLIGHT  That's affirmative. BMAG 2 is in WARM UP.
56:33:06              EECOM  I think we'll go ahead and turn that down - we still have the LM with us, right?
56:33:10             FLIGHT  That's affirmative.
56:33:11              EECOM  So - if we shut down the SCS we ought to be a little better off, perhaps. I
                             think we ought to press on and go down through BMAG 2 OFF, and get those lights
                             minimum.
56:33:23             FLIGHT  Okay. How much you want to power down? Another 10 amps?
56:33:26              EECOM  Let's get the BMAG off and get the lights down to a minimum. Let's go down two
                             more steps.
56:33:30             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, we want to power down a little bit more. Want to get the BMAG off
                             and the lights minimum there.
56:33:57             FLIGHT  Okay, Sy. Now, how long do you want to leave this battery online?
56:34:03              EECOM  I want to try and get it off as quick as I can -
56:34:04             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      EECOM  - but I need to get the power down.
56:34:07              EECOM  The crew did report they removed FUEL CELL 3 - they open-circuited it also,
                             didn't they?
56:34:13             FLIGHT  I don't believe so.
56:34:14              EECOM  FUEL CELL 1 and FUEL CELL 3 should be open-circuited.
56:34:17             CAPCOM  We just had our last call for FUEL CELL 1 open-circuit, and we left FUEL CELL 3
                             as it was.
56:34:23              EECOM  Let's take this open-circuit, FUEL CELL 3.
56:34:24             FLIGHT  Open-circuit FUEL CELL 3.
56:34:26              EECOM  Get it off the bus.
56:34:29                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:34:32             FLIGHT  Calling, FLIGHT. Say again?
56:34:34                GNC  This is GNC, FLIGHT.
56:34:35             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
56:34:35                GNC  Yeah, we've used a total of about 70 pounds RCS. We'd like to change the jet
                             configurations, see if that'll help us out any.
56:34:45             FLIGHT  Okay, what do you want to try now?
56:34:47                GNC  We'd like to turn the Bravo jets all to be OFF, and all Delta to MAIN A.
56:34:55             FLIGHT  Turn all Bravo OFF, and Delta to MAIN A, right?
56:34:58                GNC  Roger. That will verify that it isn't a Bravo thruster that's causing the
                             problem with attitudes.
56:35:04             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, we'd like to turn all Bravo jets OFF and all Delta jets to MAIN A.
56:35:14             CAPCOM  Roger.
56:35:16              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:35:17             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:35:17              EECOM  Let's take BATTERY A off the MAIN.
56:35:20             FLIGHT  We can support the -
56:35:22              EECOM  That's affirm.
                     FLIGHT  - MAIN now on the one fuel cell even with the cryo O₂ going down?
56:35:26              EECOM  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
56:35:28             FLIGHT  Okay. What's your worry level on cryo O₂?
56:35:32              EECOM  Say again, FLIGHT?
56:35:34             FLIGHT  Okay. You want to -
56:35:35              EECOM  I want to save the battery, FLIGHT.
56:35:37             FLIGHT  Okay. Let's see, what battery have we got online, Sy?
56:35:41              EECOM  Say again?
56:35:41             FLIGHT  What battery have we got online?
56:35:43              EECOM  BATTERY Alpha, FLIGHT.
56:35:44             FLIGHT  BATTERY A, okay.
56:35:45              EECOM  And next step, of course, we'll then think - we've got to worry about getting
                             some power on MAIN B to get the pressure back up in O₂ TANK 1.
56:35:51             FLIGHT  Roger. Turn BATTERY A OFF, CAPCOM.
56:36:15              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:36:16             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:36:17              EECOM  Let's have them isolate the surge tank also, and save it. We'll use the cryo as
                             much as we can.
56:36:23             FLIGHT  Say that again?
56:36:25              EECOM  Let's isolate the surge tanks -
56:36:26             FLIGHT  Why that?
                      EECOM  - in the Command Module.
56:36:28             FLIGHT  I don't understand that, Sy.
56:36:29              EECOM  I don't want to - I want to use the cryo as much as possible.
56:36:32             FLIGHT  But that would seem to be the opposite, if you want to keep the fuel cell going.
56:36:36              EECOM  The fuel cells are fed off the tanks in the Service Module, FLIGHT. The surge
                             tank is in the Command Module. We want to save the surge tank and use it for
                             re-entry.
56:36:46             FLIGHT  Okay, I'm with you. I'm with you.
56:36:49              EECOM  Roger.
56:36:50             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, let's also isolate the surge tank.
56:36:57             CAPCOM  Okay, you want to isolate the surge tank.
56:37:00             FLIGHT  Yeah.
56:37:01             CAPCOM  O₂ surge tank, right?
56:37:01             FLIGHT  Yeah. What we're really doing is securing our entry systems right now.
56:37:29             FLIGHT  Yeah, we're trying to figure out some way to get power on BUS B.
56:37:59             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:38:10             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:38:11              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:38:12             FLIGHT  Did you consider putting a battery on BUS B long enough to get the pressure up?
56:38:16              EECOM  Well, I'm trying - I want to determine whether or not the - the 5 amps is going
                             to hurt us any. That's going to be on MAIN A, incidentally. I made a mistake.
                             O₂ TANK 1 HEATERS are on MAIN A.
56:38:28             FLIGHT  Well, we've got MAIN A with us, haven't we?
56:38:46              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:38:47             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
56:38:47              EECOM  Okay. Since O₂ TANK 1 HEATERS are on MAIN A, and we've got them off now, we'll
                             be able to stand the 5 amps temporarily for manual pressurization. Let's have
                             them turn the heaters on manually in O₂ TANK 1.
56:39:03             FLIGHT  O₂ -
56:39:03              EECOM  And we'll watch the pressure.
                     FLIGHT  - TANK 1.
56:39:14              EECOM  That's CRYOGENIC O₂ HEATER 1, FLIGHT.
56:39:17                GNC  FLIGHT, we copy that. No problem.
56:39:19             FLIGHT  No problem, CAPCOM.
56:39:22             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, we want to get CRYO O₂ TANK number 1 HEATER ON.
56:39:45             FLIGHT  You can stand the 5 amps on MAIN A?
56:39:47              EECOM  That's affirm. We think so, FLIGHT.
56:40:07             FLIGHT  Did you see your 5 amp increase in current there, EECOM?
56:40:13              EECOM  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
56:40:14             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:40:14              EECOM  26.7 volts, looks good -
56:40:17             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      EECOM   - we'll watch the pressure.
56:40:18              EECOM  FLIGHT, to be consistent we ought to isolate the REPRESS package also.
56:40:24             FLIGHT  Okay, you want to isolate REPRESS pack.
56:40:40             FLIGHT  AFD, from FLIGHT.
56:40:43                AFD  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
56:40:43             FLIGHT  Get one of your guys full-time in the back room keeping track of the spacecraft
                             configuration as we pass it up to the crew. You might use Larry. Why don't you
                             stay on, get Larry in the back room to keep track of configuration stuff we
                             give to the crew?
56:40:55                AFD  Okay, FLIGHT.
56:40:56             FLIGHT  Okay?
56:40:57                AFD  And we've got the voice recorder and we're starting to transcribe that.
56:41:01             FLIGHT  Okay, now has anybody started the delog of the initial problem? You've got a
                             delog going? Have you got people that are going to be in a position to evaluate
                             it?
56:41:12             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:41:22             FLIGHT  TELMU and CONTROL, from FLIGHT.
56:41:25            CONTROL  Go, FLIGHT.
56:41:26             FLIGHT  Roger. I want LM manning around the clock.
56:41:29            CONTROL  Roger.
56:41:30              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:41:31             FLIGHT  Go ahead, EECOM.
56:41:32              EECOM  I want the fans on in O₂ tank 1, we're not seeing a pressure increase. We can
                             stand it.
56:41:38             FLIGHT  You can stand it?
56:41:40              EECOM  That's affirm.
56:41:41             FLIGHT  Fans on in TANK 1, right?
56:41:44              EECOM  Affirmative, FLIGHT.
56:41:46             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, do you want to bring the fans on in TANK 1?
56:41:48              EECOM  It's just 1 amp, FLIGHT.
56:41:50             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:41:52              EECOM  Okay, he's got an MC&W for - varied reasons.
56:42:20                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:42:22             FLIGHT  Go ahead, GNC.
56:42:23                GNC  It looks like the vehicle has stabilized considerably over the last few minutes.
56:42:28             FLIGHT  Okay. That could mean one of two things. Either whatever was venting has
                             stopped venting, it's empty; or do you feel it could also be associated with
                             the thruster Quad Bravo we just isolated?
56:42:41                GNC  It's possible, FLIGHT. We really don't know yet, though.
56:42:45             FLIGHT  Okay. Are we essentially in a - can you figure out what orientation we are from
                             a standpoint of thermal control? Assume - what's our rate right now?
56:42:55                GNC  Right now he has a -0.10 of a degree in pitch. And yaw and roll are very close
                             to 0.
56:43:01             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:43:02              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:43:03             FLIGHT  Go ahead, EECOM.
56:43:04              EECOM  The pressure in O₂ TANK 1 is all the way down to 297, we'd better think about
                             getting in the LM, or using the LM systems. I'm going to have to power way
                             down; I don't know if I'm going to be able to save the O₂ for the third fuel
                             cell - for FUEL CELL 2, rather.
56:43:19             FLIGHT  The heaters aren't working, now let's start thinking circuit breakers. You got
                             any circuit breakers you want to check, there?
56:43:27              EECOM  We saw the current, FLIGHT.
56:43:28             FLIGHT  You saw the current - okay, look -
56:43:32              EECOM  Let's check it anyway, FLIGHT, you're right.
56:43:33             FLIGHT  It looks like it's cycling up a PCM count from 297 to 302. Give me some circuit
                             breakers to check.
56:43:39              EECOM  Okay, panel 226. CRYOGENIC O₂ HEATER 1, MAIN A circuit breaker.
56:43:49             FLIGHT  I'm sorry, I didn't catch you there. CRYO O₂ TANK 1? Panel 226?
56:43:53              EECOM  CYRO O₂ HEATER 1, MAIN A, panel 226.
56:43:57             FLIGHT  Roger.
56:43:58              EECOM  Also, FLIGHT, let's check the FAN MOTOR circuit breakers TANK 1, on panel 226
                             also.
56:44:08             FLIGHT  FAN MOTOR.
56:44:10              EECOM  CRYO FAN MOTORS TANK 1. There are three circuit breakers - three phase.
56:44:18             FLIGHT  Get that, CAPCOM?
56:44:20             CAPCOM  I've got the 226 CRYO O₂ HEATER 1 MAIN A, and CRYO FAN MOTORS TANK 1, three of
                             them on -
56:44:27             FLIGHT  That's right. All three phases.
56:44:31             FLIGHT  EECOM, I don't think we're going to come to any solution here until we get back
                             to the initial set of conditions, so I hope you got a set of guys looking at
                             the delog pretty soon.
56:44:50             FLIGHT  TELMU, from FLIGHT.
56:44:52              TELMU  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
56:44:52             FLIGHT  I want you to get some guys figuring out minimum power in the LM to sustain
                             life.
56:44:57              TELMU  Roger.
56:44:58             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:45:17             CAPCOM  We got the circuit breakers. All in, FLIGHT.
56:45:22             FLIGHT  Roger. Copy, all circuit breakers in.
56:46:15              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:46:15             FLIGHT  Go ahead, EECOM.
56:46:16              EECOM  Don't we have both BMAGs OFF?
56:46:26             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, would you verify that both BMAGs are OFF, please?
56:46:40             FLIGHT  You want to bring it off, right EECOM?
56:46:43              EECOM  Affirmative, FLIGHT.
56:46:44             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, let's get it off.
56:47:32             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, from FLIGHT.
56:47:34             CAPCOM  Go, FLIGHT.
56:47:35             FLIGHT  Will you get a cockpit panel 1, 2 layout and have the crew - just get the thing
                             and have the crew read across all instruments, all gauges, and write down
                             exactly what they read in those things?
56:47:48             CAPCOM  Okay. You want a survey of panels 1 and 2 on gauges? 
56:47:53             FLIGHT  Yeah.
56:47:54             CAPCOM  Okay. And talkbacks, huh?
56:47:57             FLIGHT  That's affirmative. Figure out some code that you can use and - I think that's
                             something we should have gotten started a while ago.
56:48:10                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
56:48:21             FLIGHT  See that juice is still going down there, EECOM. You got any more suggestions?
56:48:28              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:48:29             FLIGHT  Any more suggestions in trying to pump up O₂ TANK 1 pressure?
56:48:32              EECOM  No. FLIGHT, we're gonna hit 100psi in 1 hour and 54 minutes. That's the end,
                             right there.
56:48:47             FLIGHT  Okay, 100psi -
56:48:49              EECOM  Less than 2 hours, now.
56:50:56             FLIGHT  FDO, from FLIGHT.
56:50:57                FDO  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
56:50:58             FLIGHT  Whatever planning you do, I want to do assuming that we're going around the
                             Moon and we're using the LM for performing maneuvers, because in the present
                             configuration, unless we get a heckuva lot smarter I think we're wasting our
                             time planning and using the SPS.
56:51:13                FDO  Okay, FLIGHT.
56:51:14             FLIGHT  So I think all of our return-to-Earth type planning should be assuming the use
                             of the LM DPS and/or RCS. And I think third priority down the line should be
                             CSM RCS.
56:51:27                FDO  Okay, and I'm assuming that you want fast-as-possible return.
56:51:32             FLIGHT  Yeah, I think that's the case.
56:51:34                FDO  Okay. We'll work on it from that sideline, FLIGHT -
56:51:36             FLIGHT  Okay.
                        FDO  Should be no problem.
56:51:38              GUIDO  I copy that, FLIGHT.
56:51:46              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:51:48             FLIGHT  Go ahead, EECOM.
56:51:49              EECOM  Okay, listen. There is a possibility that we blew a O₂ line in one of the fuel
                             cells, and it's effectively manifolded there, of course. Now, I'm - I want to
                             shut off one of the reactant valves to one of the fuel cells. And that would be
                             FUEL CELL 3, since its O₂ pressure is gone. Now, FUEL CELL 1's O₂ pressure is
                             trying to stay up there, at 45psi. Maybe the problem is in FUEL CELL 3.
56:52:24             FLIGHT  That sounds like a good assumption, right there.
56:52:26              EECOM  Yeah. FUEL CELL 3 is lost anyways, FLIGHT.
56:52:29                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:52:30             FLIGHT  Go ahead, GNC.
56:52:31                GNC  Turn Charlie 1 thruster OFF.
56:52:34             FLIGHT  You want to turn Charlie 1 OFF? Why?
56:52:36                GNC  Well, looks like we're getting a lot of firing out for no reason.
56:52:41             FLIGHT  Okay, CAPCOM, recommend THRUSTER C-1 to OFF.
56:52:56             CAPCOM  Say again, FLIGHT?
56:52:57             FLIGHT  THRUSTER C-1 to OFF.
56:53:00             CAPCOM  C-1 and -2 OFF.
56:53:01             FLIGHT  No. C-1. OFF. I added a word in there. Turn THRUSTER C-1 OFF.
56:53:25             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:53:26              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:53:27             FLIGHT  Why don't you show me where you think that problem is?
56:53:29              EECOM  Okay. Clint's coming up.
56:55:16              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:55:23             FLIGHT  Go ahead, EECOM.
56:55:24              EECOM  We need to get the - make sure the inline heaters for FUEL CELLS 1 and 3 are
                             OFF.
56:55:50             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:55:51              EECOM  FLIGHT.
56:55:52             FLIGHT  You want to shut off both reactant valves to FUEL CELL number 3?
56:55:54              EECOM  It's dead anyway, FLIGHT.
56:55:56             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:55:56              EECOM  And the inline heaters OFF in FUEL CELLS 1 and 3, please.
56:56:00             FLIGHT  What we're proposing here - supposing here, CAPCOM, is we may have a - had some
                             problem in FUEL CELL number 3 since that's the one that's reading no O₂ right
                             now. And we may be losing our O₂ through FUEL CELL number 3, the O₂ manifold -
                             inasmuch as they're manifolded together commonly. Looks like the O₂ in FUEL
                             CELL 1 and 2 seem to be trying to stay up there. And FUEL CELL 3 looks like
                             it's the oddball here.
56:56:43             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, let's close the REACTANT VALVE to FUEL CELL number 3.
56:56:49             CAPCOM  Okay, close REACTANT VALVE to FUEL CELL number 3.
56:56:53             CAPCOM  And you're saying that 1 and 2 look okay?
56:56:57             FLIGHT  Well, what it looks like - looks like the pressure's trying to stay up there
                             and this is the best guess we've got right now because we've got to stop this
                             O₂ flow.
56:57:04             CAPCOM  Okay.
56:57:13                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
56:57:14             FLIGHT  GO, GNC.
56:57:15                GNC  Some more jet reconfigurations to see if we can hold the attitude.
56:57:18             FLIGHT  Okay.
56:57:19                GNC  We'd like to turn Charlie 2 OFF -
56:57:20             FLIGHT  Wait, why are we interested in holding attitude? If we're not venting why not
                             drift for a while? That would probably be better from a standpoint of thermal
                             control anyway, wouldn't it?
56:57:28                GNC  I'd think we'd like to get into a controlled drift rather than just some random
                             thing, FLIGHT.
56:57:34             FLIGHT  Standby.
56:57:55             FLIGHT  Do you want them to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shutdown, Sy? I
                             assume you do - heaters and all?
56:58:01             FLIGHT  EECOM?
56:58:03              EECOM  That's affirm, FLIGHT. He's gone through much of it already, got the pumps off.
56:58:06             FLIGHT  Okay. You want them to go through the whole fuel cell shutdown. Heaters and all.
56:58:10              EECOM  Heaters, reactant valves, and the pumps of course he's already done.
56:58:13             FLIGHT  Okay. Have them go ahead, CAPCOM.
56:58:15              EECOM  And get the inline heaters OFF on FUEL CELL 1 also, FLIGHT.
56:58:19             FLIGHT  Inline heaters OFF on FUEL CELL 1.
56:58:21              EECOM  Roger, it'll cut the current requirement down, anyway.
56:58:55             CAPCOM  The COMM holding up? Sounds like he's going out.
56:58:58             FLIGHT  How you doing there, INCO? From a standpoint of OMNI-switching?
56:59:02               INCO  We might be a little better on Bravo.
56:59:04             FLIGHT  Okay. Can you figure me out some way to keep communications and yet cut down a
                             bit on the load? You might talk to EECOM on it.
56:59:11               INCO  Okay. We can turn the tape recorder OFF.
56:59:14             FLIGHT  EECOM, from FLIGHT.
56:59:15              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
56:59:16             FLIGHT  You don't need the tape recorder, do you?
56:59:17              EECOM  Heck, no. Get it off.
56:59:18             FLIGHT  Let's get it off.
56:59:21               INCO  It may be already off, but that's one thing we don't need.
56:59:24              EECOM  Let's go down the list as much of that INCO stuff as we can get, FLIGHT. I
                             think that's about the one biggie right there.
56:59:30               INCO  Is that the only thing we can give up? We turn the POWER AMPL OFF, we won't get
                             HIGH BIT RATE.
56:59:35             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, from FLIGHT.
56:59:36             CAPCOM  Go.
56:59:37             FLIGHT  Let's also verify tape recorders OFF, please.
56:59:40             CAPCOM  Okay, I think we -
56:59:42             FLIGHT  I don't think we got down that far on the list, did we? We went through the
                             BMAGs and that was lights - BMAGs and lights, and I think we stopped right
                             there.
56:59:49             CAPCOM  Yeah.
56:59:50              EECOM  Yeah, that's affirm, FLIGHT. Tape record - we'll skip a step and go tape
                             recorder OFF.
57:00:12           RECOVERY  AFD, meet RECOVERY. RECOVERY loop.
57:00:18             FLIGHT  What was that, CAPCOM?
57:00:22              GUIDO  We copy, FLIGHT.
57:00:23             FLIGHT  What was that, GUIDANCE?
57:00:25              GUIDO  He had an 06 18 he couldn't get rid of; he's got rid of it now.
57:01:04                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
57:01:18             CAPCOM  Okay, FLIGHT. I had them reading off a lot of gauge readings, and we got over
                             to FUEL CELL 3. And I hope your people were copying all this down.
57:01:27             FLIGHT  Did you get some kind of master? We got it on tape, I'm sure we can get it off
                             the tape.
57:01:32             CAPCOM  Alright. That's affirm. I'd say I have 95% of the ones he read.
57:01:35             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:02:18                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
57:02:19             FLIGHT  Go, FDO.
57:02:20                FDO  When the systems men can stand it, I need two minutes for a checkpoint to save
                             all this data.
57:02:26             FLIGHT  I don't see why we couldn't - EECOM, GNC, can you stand a checkpoint right now?
57:02:36              EECOM  It only takes a minute, I guess I'll have to if we need it, FLIGHT.
57:02:38                GNC  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:02:39             FLIGHT  Yeah, I think it'd be good to get a checkpoint. Go ahead.
57:02:41             FLIGHT  EECOM, have you deduced anything - have you seen your REACTANT VALVES go off?
                             You seen flow cease?
57:02:51              EECOM  Can't tell, FLIGHT.
57:02:52             FLIGHT  Yeah.
57:02:52              EECOM  They were open-circuited, and the pressure - still appears to be going down.
57:02:59             FLIGHT  Yup.
57:03:27                FDO  Negative, FLIGHT.
57:03:37              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:03:38             FLIGHT  Go, EECOM.
57:03:39              EECOM  We'd better confirm that the FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT VALVE circuit breaker on
                             panel 226 was closed when he shut those.
57:03:47             FLIGHT  FUEL CELL 3 REACTANT circuit breaker on what panel?
57:03:51              EECOM  226.
57:03:54              EECOM  They're normally open.
57:03:58             FLIGHT  Okay, good idea.
57:04:00             CAPCOM  You want them - close the circuit breaker -
57:04:02             FLIGHT  Yeah.
                     CAPCOM  - on the valve, and then -
57:04:03             FLIGHT  Yeah.
57:04:05              EECOM  Yeah, FLIGHT; he should have gotten a barber pole on that.
57:04:17             FLIGHT  Yeah, wouldn't he get a barber pole when he turned the reactants off? EECOM?
57:04:22              EECOM  Affirm, FLIGHT.
57:04:24             FLIGHT  Even with the circuit breaker open?
57:04:26              EECOM  No -
57:04:26             FLIGHT  No. Okay, so he ought to know that. We can just verify that he got a -
57:04:35                FDO  Okay, FLIGHT. We have our checkpoint.
57:04:37             FLIGHT  Okay. All flight controllers, I'd suggest you start handing over, because I
                             think a fresh team's probably going to be thinking clearer. I think the rest of
                             us can continue working in some other function in support of the new team
                             coming on.
57:04:49                GNC  Go on thruster A-4, FLIGHT.
57:04:51             FLIGHT  Okay. Go on thruster A-4, CAPCOM.
57:04:52               INCO  OMNI Charlie, FLIGHT.
57:04:53             FLIGHT  Roger. And OMNI Charlie.
57:06:13             FLIGHT  Okay. All flight controllers, I'm handing over to Glynn. I assume the majority
                             of all the team guys are pretty much briefed and up to speed as best we can.
                             Now what I'd suggest is the white team do two things: they go over the delogs -
                             okay - let me go back over this again. We're handing over to Glynn. I'd suggest
                             the white team goes back and starts going through the delog of the data. In
                             other words, let's see if we can go back to the initial conditions and work on
                             that problem to see if we can find out what happened and we may find some
                             better clues as to what to do and let the fresh guys come on and try to figure
                             out where do we go from here.
57:06:53             FLIGHT  And the delog is in way now. Roger.
57:07:14             FLIGHT  Okay, EECOM. Tell me about the latch. Do you think you've got the reactants
                             latched?
57:07:20              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:07:21             FLIGHT  Go.
57:07:22              EECOM  The crew reported he got barber pole whenever he threw the reactant switch, so
                             that implies that he did all the right things and he really got it shut off.
                             And it looks like that didn't help us any - the pressure's not improving any.
57:07:37             FLIGHT  Okay, now the next question is: are you willing to do that on FUEL CELL number
                             1?
57:07:42              EECOM  That's the question we're pondering, FLIGHT. We've got to come up with an
                             answer on that one.
57:07:47             FLIGHT  Soon. FUEL CELL 2 is working okay.
57:07:49              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:07:51             FLIGHT  Unless we do something to get that oxygen, it's not going to do us any good to
                             save fuel cells.
57:07:56              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:07:57             FLIGHT  Okay - okay. GNC, FLIGHT.
57:08:01                GNC  GNC.
57:08:02             FLIGHT  You stabilized now? - standby.
57:08:06             FLIGHT  Here comes configuration, I think it's yours.
57:08:34             FLIGHT  I didn't copy all those; did you, GNC?
57:08:36                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. We concur.
57:08:38             FLIGHT  Is that good? How are the rates?
57:08:41             CAPCOM  You copy those, GNC?
57:08:42                GNC  It's holding down around a tenth of a degree per second, FLIGHT. Oscillating,
                             he's in ACCEL CMD, so -
57:08:50             FLIGHT  ACCEL CMD?
57:08:51                GNC  Right.
57:08:53             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:08:57             CAPCOM  FLIGHT, did you copy all those thrusters?
57:08:59             FLIGHT  Go ahead. Who's calling?
57:09:02             CAPCOM  CAPCOM. Did you copy all those -
57:09:03             FLIGHT  I didn't copy them all, Jack. GNC, did you copy them all?
57:09:06                GNC  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
57:09:07             FLIGHT  Do you like that configuration for right now?
57:09:09                GNC  Yes.
57:09:10             FLIGHT  As best you can tell - best you can tell, the rates are okay. And he's flying
                             ACCEL CMD.
57:09:19                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT.
57:09:20             FLIGHT  No rate damping, then, right?
57:09:22                GNC  Roger.
57:09:24             FLIGHT  Are both BMAG packages off?
57:09:27                GNC  Yes, they are.
57:09:29             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:09:45             FLIGHT  Standby. EECOM, you need anything?
57:09:51              EECOM  Roger, FLIGHT. We'll take those.
57:09:53             CAPCOM  We want those?
57:09:55              EECOM  Roger.
57:09:57             FLIGHT  What do you want?
57:09:59              EECOM  Get him to go through the meters -
57:10:00             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      EECOM  - on FUEL CELL 1 and 3.
57:10:02             FLIGHT  Okay. Just FUEL CELL 1 and 3, Jack.
57:11:25             FLIGHT  EECOM, I don't like the way that O₂ pressure's going down. If you want to do
                             something about these other reactant valves, let's make up our mind.
57:11:31              EECOM  Okay.
57:11:32             FLIGHT  Don't you think?
57:11:32              EECOM  Let me get that for you in a minute, FLIGHT. Let's standby on these readouts.
57:11:36             FLIGHT  Yeah, okay. Anybody can copy the readouts. Be sure you're discussing these
                             reactants.
57:11:54             CAPCOM  Hey, FLIGHT. CAPCOM. Long time ago I heard someone mention something about
                             closing the REPRESS package and then we never made a decision on that. Do you
                             want to do that, too?
57:12:03             FLIGHT  EECOM? - he's busy.
57:12:06              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
57:12:07             FLIGHT  Do you want to close out the REPRESS pack? I think that came on for them before.
57:12:12              EECOM  We indicated earlier that we'd like to get it closed off -
57:12:14             FLIGHT  Yes, Jack.
57:12:23              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:12:24             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:12:25              EECOM  Okay, on the reactants for FUEL CELL 1. Seems to me we have no choice but to go
                             ahead and do it. The pressure continues to drop. We're not going to have
                             anything left soon anyway. So, looks like the next best thing to try is to go
                             ahead and turn the reactants OFF on FUEL CELL 1.
57:12:43             FLIGHT  Yeah. What is this pounds on your display, Clint?
57:12:47              EECOM  On O₂?
57:12:48             FLIGHT  Yup.
57:12:49              EECOM  That's - that's invalid.
57:12:51             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:12:57              EECOM  And of course, you'll want to make sure that his circuit breaker is closed for
                             FUEL CELL 1 when he starts to close the reactant valves.
57:13:04             FLIGHT  Which circuit breaker is that? The one on 226?
57:13:06              EECOM  Roger.
57:13:10             FLIGHT  That's FUEL CELL number 1.
57:13:12              EECOM  That's right, FUEL CELL reactants number 1.
57:13:14             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:13:16             FLIGHT  Is he done with that readout yet?
57:13:20              EECOM  I didn't copy the last part of it there, FLIGHT -
57:13:32             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:13:34              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
57:13:34             FLIGHT  Is there any chance that I'm just looking at a bad pressure reading here? I'm
                             going to shut off the second fuel cell now, is there any data you can correlate
                             that says that yeah, that pressure is going down?
57:13:45              EECOM  On the O₂ tank?
57:13:46             FLIGHT  Yes.
57:13:52             FLIGHT  You understand my question?
57:13:52              EECOM  I understand your question. The temperatures are also dropping. Let me get a
                             verification on that - standby just a minute.
57:14:00             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:14:15             FLIGHT  Yeah, we copy that. Tell them we're debating shutting off the reactants on 1.
57:14:19              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:14:19             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:14:20              EECOM  The temperature is the only thing we have.
57:14:22             FLIGHT  And does it correlate?
57:14:23              EECOM  Pretty closely.
57:14:24             FLIGHT  You're saying that I'm looking at a valid pressure in that tank, and it's still
                             going down.
57:14:28              EECOM  That's the way it looks, FLIGHT.
57:14:29             FLIGHT  Therefore?
57:14:30              EECOM  Therefore we need to go to FUEL CELL 1 and turn off the reactants.
57:14:34             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FUEL CELL 1 reactants. Circuit breaker and a switch.
57:14:38             CAPCOM  Okay - you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?
57:14:42             FLIGHT  EECOM?
57:14:43              EECOM  Say again, FLIGHT?
57:14:43             FLIGHT  Do you want them to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on 1?
57:14:47              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:14:48             FLIGHT  Yes, Jack.
57:14:50             CAPCOM  Because -
57:14:51             FLIGHT  Because the tank 1 is still going down. Pressure and temp - pressure going
                             down, temperature confirms it.
57:14:57             CAPCOM  Okay.
57:15:05             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:15:06              EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:15:07             FLIGHT  Of course, you want to ask yourself if you want to open 3.
57:15:13              EECOM  Open 3?
57:15:14             FLIGHT  Yeah. You don't want to do that?
57:15:16              EECOM  Negative, let's leave 3 like it is.
57:15:26                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
57:15:28             FLIGHT  Standby.
57:15:31             FLIGHT  What MAIN BUS do you want up?
57:15:33              EECOM  MAIN A.
57:15:34             FLIGHT  Just like we -
57:15:34              EECOM  Just like it is.
57:15:35             FLIGHT  Just like it is. FUEL CELL 2's on MAIN A.
57:15:39              EECOM  That's affirm.
57:15:41               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
57:15:41             FLIGHT  Go.
57:15:42               INCO  OMNI Bravo.
57:15:45             FLIGHT  OMNI Bravo, too, Jack.
57:16:01             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:16:03              EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:16:04             FLIGHT  How long can I leave that stuff off and still turn it back on? Any time at all?
57:16:08              EECOM  Negative, FLIGHT. It's like it wipes it out.
57:16:11             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:16:20             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:16:23             FLIGHT  I don't know. That's what I'm asking, but we've got that shut off now.
57:16:31             FLIGHT  Okay. When you can.
57:17:07              EECOM  That's right, FLIGHT.
57:17:08             FLIGHT  You're ready for that now. Sure, absolutely, huh EECOM?
57:17:11              EECOM  That's it, FLIGHT.
57:17:12             FLIGHT  It's still going down and it's not possible that thing is sort of bottoming
                             out, is it?
57:17:17              EECOM  Well, the rate is slower but we have a little less pressure too, so we would
                             expect it to be a little bit slower.
57:17:23             FLIGHT  You are sure, then; you want to close it.
57:17:26              EECOM  Seems to me we have no choice, FLIGHT.
57:17:31             FLIGHT  Well.
57:17:33              EECOM  Standby one minute; I'll poll my back room.
57:17:35             FLIGHT  It went down again. One more.
57:17:50              EECOM  We're go on that, FLIGHT.
57:17:52             FLIGHT  Okay. That's your best judgement; we think we ought to close that off, huh?
57:17:55              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:17:56             FLIGHT  It's dropping down to 234. Yeah. Okay. FUEL CELL number 1 REACTANTS coming OFF.
57:18:20                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
57:18:21             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:18:22                GNC  I think we can help the CMP a bit if we can tell them to enable B/D ROLL in the
                             DAP. He's got A/C turned OFF and he's got A/C selected in the DAP. Can we tell
                             him to -
57:18:31             FLIGHT  Is he under DAP control?
57:18:32                GNC  Well, he goes to it occasionally -
57:18:34             FLIGHT  Okay.
                        GNC  - he's in - RATE CMD right - ACCEL CMD right now, but -
57:18:36             FLIGHT  Okay. Okay. He's got A/C off, huh?
57:18:40                GNC  Right.
57:18:41             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, when you get a spare minute there, Jack needs to enable B/D ROLL in the
                             DAP if he wants to use it.
57:18:47             FLIGHT  If he wants to use the DAP, that is.
57:18:55             FLIGHT  Jeez, it's really going down.
57:19:18              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:19:18             FLIGHT  Go.
57:19:19              EECOM  Okay, is the - LM gotten all set up for using LM systems for supporting the CSM?
57:19:26              TELMU  That's affirmative.
57:19:27             FLIGHT  Yes.
57:19:28              EECOM  Okay. We'll get you time as to what it looks like we'll have for power here,
                             shortly.
57:19:33             FLIGHT  TELMU and CONTROL, FLIGHT.
57:19:35            CONTROL  CONTROL here.
57:19:37             FLIGHT  Keep reminding me of that heater; now I don't want to let that thing go too
                             long.
57:19:40            CONTROL  Okay. We're still trying to get some data - substantiating data on that,
                             FLIGHT. My own personal opinion is the sooner we can take care of that, the
                             better off I'm going to feel about it.
57:19:49             FLIGHT  Yeah, okay, Hal. Go get 'em.
57:19:51              TELMU  Okay; and FLIGHT, TELMU. We're working on a procedure right now that powers the
                             LM internally from its own power.
57:19:57             FLIGHT  Yes. Fine.
57:19:58               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
57:19:59             FLIGHT  Go.
57:19:59               INCO  Save you a little more power to turn the HIGH GAIN antenna switch to OFF.
57:20:03             FLIGHT  HIGH GAIN antenna OFF?
57:20:05               INCO  POWER switch OFF.
57:20:06             FLIGHT  POWER switch. You're doing okay on the OMNIs, huh?
57:20:09               INCO  Yes. We've got the 210s.
57:20:11             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, he can turn the HIGH GAIN antenna POWER switch OFF; we're doing
                             fine on the OMNIs. We've got the big dish.
57:20:17              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:20:17             FLIGHT  Go.
57:20:18              EECOM  Let's charge BATTERY A.
57:20:19             FLIGHT  Yeah, I was wondering about that. Do you - let me get the HIGH GAIN POWER off
                             first, okay? Clint?
57:20:25              EECOM  Okay.
57:20:33             FLIGHT  How much - how many amps will that give us, EECOM?
57:20:35              EECOM  About 1.3, 1.4 amps - - amp-hours per hour. The cost is about 4.5 amps.
57:20:43             FLIGHT  So it's no big deal on the amps.
57:20:44              EECOM  That's right. And we'd like to use whatever time we have to put energy back
                             into the battery.
57:20:50             FLIGHT  Yeah, and I see O₂ tank 1 pressure is 217.
57:20:53              EECOM  That's affirmative. It's still coming down.
57:20:55             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
57:20:57             CAPCOM  Go, FLIGHT - standby.
57:21:08             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, you want anything done with the CMC right now?
57:21:11              GUIDO  FLIGHT, we would like a VERB 74 before they power it down.
57:21:15             FLIGHT  VERB 74, CAPCOM.
57:21:16             CAPCOM  You ready for it now?
57:21:18              GUIDO  Standby, FLIGHT, let me the flight - site configured.
57:21:30             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:21:32              EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:21:33             FLIGHT  Does the temperature in tank 2 correspond with the pressure reading?
57:21:36              EECOM  Let me see how close it is, FLIGHT.
57:21:50              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE -
57:21:50             FLIGHT  Go.
                      GUIDO  - we're ready.
57:21:52             FLIGHT  Yeah; VERB 74 you want?
57:21:54              GUIDO  Roger.
57:21:55             FLIGHT  VERB 74.
57:22:00              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:22:00             FLIGHT  Go.
57:22:01              EECOM  Temperature and pressure correspond - they verify that the pressure reading's
                             right.
57:22:06             FLIGHT  In tank 2?
57:22:08              EECOM  In tank - standby.
57:22:13              EECOM  That's right, FLIGHT. Tank 2.
57:22:14             FLIGHT  Okay. Now, is it possible that we still have that tank and it's good? And we
                             could somehow get power on B and use it?
57:22:22              EECOM  It's not likely, FLIGHT.
57:22:24             FLIGHT  What's not likely, Clint?
57:22:25              EECOM  Not likely to be able to - actually have anything left in the tank.
57:22:31             FLIGHT  You don't think so?
57:22:32              EECOM  I don't think so, but let's - we'll pulse (??) that one to you.
57:22:35             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:22:35              EECOM  Let me get you a time it looks like we've got on tank 1 here.
57:22:38             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:22:57             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
57:22:58              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
57:22:59             FLIGHT  Is there anything simple that we can refer the crew to to get them thinking
                             about using the LM here? Have you got anything - checklist, paperwork that'll
                             describe to them what your intentions are?
57:23:12              TELMU  Negative, there's nothing documented in contingency. We're thinking about using
                             the LM as a lifeboat, we have some procedures here. On the ground, though.
57:23:19             FLIGHT  I'm sure you do. What do they amount to? Flying with the tunnel open?
57:23:23              TELMU  Roger. Just a LM, low power - low - supplying power to the CSM.
57:23:28             FLIGHT  Supplying power to the CSM?
57:23:30              TELMU  Yes; about 5 amps.
57:23:33             FLIGHT  To what?
57:23:35              TELMU  To their MAIN BUS B.
57:23:37             FLIGHT  Okay. Where did - well, MAIN B is in bad shape. We don't have anything on MAIN
                             B right now. What's that power for? TELMU?
57:23:47              TELMU  Just anything they might need it for.
57:23:49             FLIGHT  GNC and EECOM?
57:23:50                GNC  Go, FLIGHT.
57:23:51             FLIGHT  What power do you need from the LM?
57:23:56              EECOM  Okay, we'll -
57:24:01             FLIGHT  That's right.
57:24:02              EECOM  We confirm that here.
57:24:07              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM. Looks like we've got about 40 minutes left in that tank.
57:24:12              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:24:13             FLIGHT  Yes.
57:24:16              EECOM  Like to get battery A on charge, FLIGHT.
57:24:21             FLIGHT  Now -
57:24:45             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, just for his information we're not going to do a DPS burn until we hook
                             around the Moon. Let them know that. And that's at about 79 +30.
57:25:24              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
57:25:24             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:25:25              GUIDO  We didn't get a good recording on that VERB 74, we'll need them to do it again.
57:25:31              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:25:31             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:25:32              EECOM  We'd like to get BATTERY A on charge, and we'd like to go ahead and get some
                             more power off if we can. I'm not sure what the situation is on getting the
                             computer up -
57:25:40             FLIGHT  Clint, let me ask you now, is there anything you want to do - trying to pump up
                             the other tank? Anything? Are you satisfied that both of these tanks are going
                             down and we're past helping them? Even with batteries? That's what I'm getting
                             at.
57:25:53             FLIGHT  I'm trying to be sure that you're satisfied that there's nothing else we can do.
57:25:57              EECOM  About all we can do is power down and let heat leak help us some - which is
                             probably going to be trivial.
57:26:03             FLIGHT  Okay. There's nothing else you want to try.
57:26:07             FLIGHT  That's the only reason I'm delaying on this BATTERY A charge, Clint; to be sure
                             you've gone through everything and you don't have any other tricks up your
                             sleeve.
57:26:13              EECOM  Sure don't, FLIGHT.
57:26:15             FLIGHT  Okay, what are other power do you want to take off before we start the charge?
57:26:18              EECOM  Well, looks like we're going to get into the control area. Whatever they can
                             give up we'll have to come up with, here.
57:26:23             FLIGHT  Okay, are you ready to go ahead and charge BATTERY A?
57:26:26              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:26:26             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, why don't they get all they can in BATTERY A?
57:26:29             CAPCOM  Okay, and Jack also asked me if we wanted to get a P52 and get the LM platform
                             up with the -
57:26:35             FLIGHT  What do you think of that? GUIDANCE?
57:26:38              GUIDO  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:26:39             FLIGHT  CONTROL. Question is, do you want to do a quick P52 on the CSM so that we can
                             do an align to the LM? I don't know if we want to keep that LM platform up all
                             that time anyway.
57:26:47            CONTROL  That's too much power in my mind, FLIGHT, to keep that thing running for all
                             that time.
57:26:51             FLIGHT  Okay, therefore you don't -
57:26:53            CONTROL  My vote is not to do that.
57:26:54             FLIGHT  Yeah.
57:26:55              GUIDO  Mine, too.
57:26:56             FLIGHT  Okay, CAPCOM, we don't see any need in doing that, because we wouldn't be using
                             the LM platform until about 79 hours.
57:27:03             CAPCOM  Okay, you don't want to worry about the LM platform. We'll align it later with
                             the AOT, huh?
57:27:11            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
57:27:16             FLIGHT  Yeah.
57:27:41             FLIGHT  Did you say BATTERY A charge?
57:27:42             CAPCOM  Yup.
57:27:43             FLIGHT  Okay. EECOM, we charging A? Watch it, there, okay?
57:27:46              EECOM  I'm watching; it's fine.
57:27:48             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:27:51             FLIGHT  EECOM?
57:27:52              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
57:27:53             FLIGHT  Go one more time around that room. We're letting this thing go down, although I
                             realize we don't have any more thoughts to do, but I want to be sure that if
                             there's anything we can do here, that we're doing it. To keep your -
57:28:04              EECOM  Just power down, FLIGHT. All we can power down will put us in that much better
                             configuration.
57:28:08             FLIGHT  Okay, I got that part but are there any other things that you can do besides
                             that, is what I'm getting at?
57:28:13              EECOM  Negative, FLIGHT.
57:28:14             FLIGHT  Okay. GNC, can you help EECOM there as to what else you might power down, if
                             anything? I don't know whether you can or not.
57:28:20                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. We'll work on that, although we're in an ATTITUDE HOLD situation
                             here, and I'd hate to give up the CMC and the IMU right now.
57:28:29             FLIGHT  Yeah, well the CMC doesn't matter.
57:28:35                GNC  Okay, we'll work on it, FLIGHT.
57:28:35              EECOM  FLIGHT, we're not going to have anything in about 40 minutes here.
57:28:50              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:28:56              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:28:58             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:28:59              EECOM  Okay, we've got an update on the time. Looks like we've got about 18 minutes
                             until we get down to 100psi, and that's the cutoff point.
57:29:05             FLIGHT  Alright. But we're charging BATTERY A.
57:29:07              EECOM  Well, that doesn't mean much in 18 minutes, though. But we're doing all we can
                             do.
57:29:10             FLIGHT  Alright. CONTROL and GUIDANCE, one more time.
57:29:14              GUIDO  Go ahead.
57:29:15            CONTROL  Go, FLIGHT.
57:29:15             FLIGHT  Will it do any good at all to - TELMU, FLIGHT -
57:29:19              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
                     FLIGHT  - join in here. The question is, should we try to do a quick align with the CSM
                             and do an alignment in the LM? Can we keep an alignment in the LM up until 79
                             hours? Can you keep that kind of power on?
57:29:31              TELMU  Standby.
57:29:32             FLIGHT  The pilots are reporting it's difficult to do that alignment from scratch in
                             the LM docked.
57:29:40             FLIGHT  And we get a tradeoff here as to whether we can stand that kind of power.
57:29:45              TELMU  Standby 1, FLIGHT.
57:29:47             FLIGHT  Alright. Pronto.
57:29:57                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC. We'd save a little power if we turn all the jets off in QUAD C.
                             We're pulsing those jets and we suspect that we've - closed the PROP ISOL
                             VALVES in QUAD C so it's doing us no good right now, so we need to turn off all
                             the jets in the quad.
57:30:14             FLIGHT  Oh, okay, RCS SELECT -
57:30:15                GNC  Right.
                     FLIGHT  RCS SELECT ?? check.
57:30:27             FLIGHT  EECOM? Any need to dump water?
57:30:34              EECOM  Negative on that, FLIGHT.
57:30:36             FLIGHT  No sweat there, Jack.
57:30:46              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:30:47             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:30:48              EECOM  They get the POWER AMPL off? I heard them talking about it a while ago. I don't
                             know.
57:30:51               INCO  No, they don't.
57:30:53              EECOM  We can eliminate that central in the 85 foot gainway.
57:30:57               INCO  That's not exactly true -
57:30:59              EECOM  Okay.
                       INCO  We're looking at it to see how far down we can go.
57:31:02             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:31:03              EECOM  I believe GNC has got some things we can turn down here.
57:31:06             FLIGHT  Yeah, he just - AUTO RCS in Quad Charlie can go off; we've got that Quad PROP
                             ISOL'd. Which I didn't know, but.
57:31:12              EECOM  Pardon?
57:31:13             FLIGHT  Quad Charlie AUTO RCS - GNC, FLIGHT.
57:31:17             FLIGHT  GNC, FLIGHT.
57:31:19                GNC  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:31:20             FLIGHT  Confirm: Quad Charlie is PROP ISOL'd off, right?
57:31:24                GNC  Well, we haven't confirmed that, FLIGHT, but it appears that that's the
                             situation we're in. The shock of the O₂ thing, it probably closed those valves -
57:31:35             FLIGHT  Oh, you think -
                        GNC  - and we haven't been able to open them because those are powered off of MAIN B.
57:31:40             FLIGHT  Mm. Okay.
57:31:41                GNC  But A appears to be working okay.
57:31:43             FLIGHT  Okay. We think Quad Charlie's PROP ISOL'd off, Jack, so in that case we ought
                             to turn off the AUTO RCS SELECT; that'll save a little power. Probably not much.
57:31:54             CAPCOM  Yeah - you want AUTO RCS OFF on Charlie?
57:31:56             FLIGHT  Uh huh.
57:31:57             CAPCOM  How about antennas? How are we doing? Did I hear them give me some bad COMM
                             there?
57:32:02               INCO  We're in pretty good shape right now, FLIGHT.
57:32:04             CAPCOM  Okay.
57:32:05             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:32:06              EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:32:07             FLIGHT  Let me try one more time. Is it possible that if we got power to MAIN B that we
                             could get TANK 2 powered up and up the pressure?
57:32:17              EECOM  We don't feel like that's a possibility, FLIGHT. We might conceivably get power
                             to B but we don't feel like we can get anything out of TANK 2.
57:32:24             FLIGHT  Okay, now why is that? Tell me why.
57:32:27              EECOM  It's because the numbers we're looking at indicate that it's essentially
                             ambient.
57:32:33             FLIGHT  Hold on.
57:32:35             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:32:39             FLIGHT  GNC, watch we don't pick up any rates now, will you please?
57:32:42                GNC  Okay, FLIGHT.
57:32:52             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:32:54              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
57:32:54             FLIGHT  How long have we got now in the cell?
57:32:56              EECOM  Last account we had 18 minutes, let me get an update.
57:32:58             FLIGHT  Okay. TELMU, what have we got to do to power up to get some COMM on the LM?
57:33:02              TELMU  Okay FLIGHT, we've got a procedure here that gets power up first on the LM.
57:33:14             FLIGHT  Yeah. EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:33:16              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
57:33:17             FLIGHT  Yeah, that gets us power but what do you want up? Just the COMM?
57:33:21              EECOM  We'll have to have an environment for the crew, the way this can be -
57:33:23             FLIGHT  That's what I'm asking you, EECOM and TELMU. We've got to figure out how -
                             we're just about out of CSM talkin'.
57:33:30              TELMU  Okay.
57:33:31             FLIGHT  What do you want them to power up in the LM?
57:33:33              TELMU  Standby 1.
57:33:35              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM -
57:33:35             FLIGHT  Alright.
                      EECOM  - out input is, here, that we'll have to live out at the LM.
57:33:38             FLIGHT  I understand.
57:33:41              EECOM  Okay.
57:33:55             FLIGHT  We've got a power up procedure here from TELMU but we've got to start thinking
                             about what you want pow - configured in the ECS and the COMM.
57:34:01              EECOM  Right.
57:34:02              TELMU  That gets power in the LM, and then we'll get you some COMM and TM here.
57:34:05             FLIGHT  Yeah - do we need to send any power to the CSM? For the platform, or anything?
                             Or, can we even do that?
57:34:13              EECOM  I'm not sure we can do that yet.
57:34:14             FLIGHT  Can't do that.
57:34:17             FLIGHT  That was a long time ago.
57:34:18             CAPCOM  Okay. When do you want them to start working on this procedure?
57:34:21             FLIGHT  Well, tell them they gotta start thinking about the power - going over and
                             powering right now because they're going to have lights problem in a little
                             while in the CSM.
57:34:27             CAPCOM  Okay, I'll send it up. And they wanted to know if we wanted them to try to
                             reset the PROPELLANT VALVES in the secondaries.
57:34:36                GNC  Yeah, roger, FLIGHT.
57:34:37             FLIGHT  GNC?
57:34:38                GNC  That won't do any good because we lost MAIN B and those valves are powered off
                             of B.
57:34:40             FLIGHT  No - no, CAPCOM. It's off MAIN B.
57:35:34             FLIGHT  EE - TELMU, FLIGHT.
57:35:36              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
57:35:36             FLIGHT  Does this title - this PG&E (??) page - mean anything more than just power up
                             the LM?
57:35:40              TELMU  No. That's all.
57:35:41             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:35:44              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:35:52              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:35:53             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:35:53              EECOM  We'd like to go ahead and power down the CSM all we can except leave that
                             battery charger on. Of course, leave a little light because we're going to be
                             there in 15 minutes anyway.
57:36:03             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, we're going to out of power in the CSM in 15 minutes in the fuel cells.
                             We want them to start getting the tunnel clear and get ready and get over there
                             and power up the LM as soon as they can, they ought to send somebody over
                             there. EECOM, what ought they do to leave the cockpit?
57:36:16              EECOM  Say again?
57:36:17             FLIGHT  EECOM and GNC. What ought we do to leave the CSM cockpit? We're going to lose
                             power on the buses, now what do you want to switch off?
57:36:27              EECOM  Power it down, FLIGHT. All of it.
57:36:27                GNC  The CMC and the IMU, mainly, FLIGHT.
57:38:24  FLIGHT (off loop)  That's the problem.
57:38:41              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:38:42             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:38:43              EECOM  Last ditch stand on O₂ tank 2, let's turn the fans on.
57:38:48              EECOM  That'll cost about 1 amp.
57:38:49             FLIGHT  What are they off? MAIN A?
57:38:52              EECOM  They're on AC.
57:38:54             FLIGHT  Okay. Fans in tank 2 ON.
57:38:57              EECOM  Fans, tank 2, ON.
57:38:59             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
57:39:02             FLIGHT  Tell them to try the fans in tank 2. They're off the AC and last ditch stand
                             we'll try the fans in tank 2. Turn the fans on in TANK 2, it only takes 1 amp.
57:39:11             CAPCOM  Okay.
57:39:26             FLIGHT  TELMU, GUIDANCE, and CONTROL; FLIGHT.
57:39:28            CONTROL  CONTROL, here.
57:39:28              GUIDO  Go, FLIGHT.
57:39:29             FLIGHT  Do you know status of the CSM platform right now?
57:39:33              GUIDO  Negative, FLIGHT. It's - good as far as we know.
57:39:38             FLIGHT  No, no, no. Do you know its orientation? Do you know its orientation?
57:39:42              GUIDO  It's PTC REFSMMAT.
57:39:44             FLIGHT  Yeah. You know what you've got, and so okay.
57:39:49             FLIGHT  EECOM?
57:39:50              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
57:39:51             FLIGHT  Did he get it? Fans 2 ON?
57:39:53              EECOM  We can't tell, FLIGHT.
57:39:55             FLIGHT  He got it, did he, Jack? Number 2 fans?
57:39:57  CAPCOM (off loop)  He said he got it.
57:39:58             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:39:59             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, CONTROL, and TELMU. The point is, should we, quick - if you guys
                             can't run out the power steady, run out - align the - your IMU to the CSM while
                             we study the problem? See what we got in the way of power?
57:40:13             FLIGHT  Tom Stafford is concerned that they'll have a hell of a time getting the
                             platform aligned in the LM with AOT.
57:40:19              GUIDO  I agree, FLIGHT.
57:40:20            CONTROL  I agree, too, FLIGHT.
57:40:21             FLIGHT  Okay. What's should we tell them to do?
57:40:24            CONTROL  It's going to take about 15, 20 minutes as I understand it to do that
                             procedure, that right GUIDANCE?
57:40:27             FLIGHT  Which procedure?
57:40:28              GUIDO  The docked alignment -
57:40:29            CONTROL  Docked align.
57:40:30             CAPCOM  How about you give me an Activation page?
57:40:31             FLIGHT  How about - a -
57:40:32              GUIDO  Well, how long does it take to -
                     FLIGHT  - how about a coarse align? At least you get - at least you start in -
57:40:36              GUIDO  Okay, that's in the ballpark, FLIGHT; that's correct.
57:40:38             FLIGHT  Okay, now. What do you - what do we do to get this done? EECOM, you got all my
                             power in the LM with that procedure? What power have you got on the LM?
57:40:45              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
57:40:46             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:40:47              GUIDO  We ought to go ahead and go a P52 first in the CSM and get -
57:40:49             FLIGHT  That's what I'm asking you -
                      GUIDO  - a reference. Right -
                     FLIGHT  - do you know? Well, do you have one now? We don't have much time! Do you have
                             a good one now? As far as you know?
57:40:56              GUIDO  A good alignment?
57:40:57             FLIGHT  Yeah, that's what I'm asking! Do you have a good alignment?
57:41:01                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
57:41:02             FLIGHT  I'm not worried about the tenths of a degree, either.
57:41:05              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:41:05              GUIDO  Well, it ought to be that good, FLIGHT.
57:41:06             FLIGHT  Yeah, okay. So we don't need to do a P52 -
57:41:07              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
                     FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:41:09              EECOM  Okay, we need to open up the surge tank. The manifold pressure is dropping.
57:41:16             FLIGHT  Uh - okay. Wouldn't you rather power that from the LM - pump that up from the
                             LM?
57:41:22              EECOM  Well, we - - we've got to get into the LM first, FLIGHT.
57:41:27             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, get them going in the LM. We've got to get the oxygen on in the LM.
57:41:37              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
57:41:44              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
57:41:45             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:41:46              TELMU  Okay, we have a procedure here. Probably the easiest thing is to refer them to
                             Activation -
57:41:52             FLIGHT  Go.
57:41:52              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
                      TELMU  - 11 and Activation 12.
57:41:55             FLIGHT  What will that do for us?
57:41:56              TELMU  That gives them the COMM -
57:41:57             FLIGHT  Okay, Activation 11 -
57:42:00              TELMU  And 12.
                     FLIGHT  - and 12. 
57:42:03              TELMU  13, step 1.
57:42:05             FLIGHT  Okay. Got that, Jack?
57:42:06              TELMU  And cross out the VHF stuff.
57:42:08             FLIGHT  Okay -
57:42:09              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
                     FLIGHT  - does that give us ECS also?
57:42:11              TELMU  That gives us glycol circulation.
57:42:13             FLIGHT  Okay, how about ECS? Come on, I need some oxygen.
57:42:16              EECOM  Disregard the surge tank request.
57:42:17             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:42:18             FLIGHT  Give me some oxygen.
57:42:19              TELMU  Negative.
57:42:19             FLIGHT  Do I need some oxygen right now?
57:42:21              TELMU  Roger - just go to Activation step 1.
57:42:26             FLIGHT  And start there, huh?
57:42:28              TELMU  Right.
57:42:29             FLIGHT  And go how many steps? Activation -
57:42:32              TELMU  Just 1. Step 3.
57:42:36             FLIGHT  Uh.
57:42:37              TELMU  Activation 1, step 3, FLIGHT.
57:42:39             FLIGHT  Step 3?
57:42:40              TELMU  Right.
57:42:40             FLIGHT  And then what? Activation 11?
57:42:43              TELMU  Activation 11 -
57:42:44             FLIGHT  12?
57:42:45              TELMU  12, 13 step 1.
57:42:48             FLIGHT  Okay. Got that, CAPCOM?
57:42:51             CAPCOM  I've got Activation 1 step 3; Activation 11, 12, 13 step 1.
57:42:55              TELMU  Roger, and FLIGHT, in Activation 11, omit step 1.
57:42:59             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:43:01             FLIGHT  Okay. That'll give them what, now; glycol flow, COMM, and some ECS? Is that
                             right? That's what we want.
57:43:08              TELMU  Roger.
57:43:08             FLIGHT  Okay. That's what we want.
57:43:26              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
57:43:26             FLIGHT  Go.
57:43:27              TELMU  One other input: we also need the DEMAND REGs to CABIN.
57:43:32             FLIGHT  Roger.
57:43:55             FLIGHT  Do you want them to do Activation 1 down to step 3 - TELMU?
57:44:00              TELMU  That's affirmative.
57:44:01             FLIGHT  It's down to step 3.
57:44:03             FLIGHT  Down to step 3.
57:44:09             FLIGHT  That's 12 and 13.
57:44:11             FLIGHT  And DEMAND REGs to CABIN.
57:44:17             FLIGHT  Right.
57:44:19             FLIGHT  TELMU, when do we do DEMAND REGs to CABIN? That's the end of those three steps?
57:44:22              TELMU  At the end of the sequence.
57:44:23             FLIGHT  At the end of the sequence, DEMAND REGs to CABIN, Jack.
57:44:27             FLIGHT  And I - I'm still not satisfied he's got Activation 1 down to step 3.
57:44:37              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM. The voltage is going to begin to drop and we'll need to power
                             down with it.
57:44:42             FLIGHT  Okay. What do you want them to do? Turn everything off?
57:44:45              EECOM  Leave the lights on, and - leave the lights on. As far as they need it.
57:44:49             FLIGHT  And where do they power it from, the LM?
57:44:51              EECOM  That'll be power from the CSM as long as we have anything. We will bring up BAT
                             A when we get down about 25 volts or so.
57:44:57             FLIGHT  Why?
57:44:59              EECOM  Until they get into the LM and keep their lights up and whatever they have to
                             have.
57:45:03                GNC  We don't want to destroy the IMU alignment in the CSM right now, so we've got
                             to keep that up, I assume, until you get the LM aligned, right?
57:45:08             FLIGHT  Mm. Okay.
57:45:11              EECOM  We'll do that by bringing BAT A on MAIN A.
57:45:14             FLIGHT  Well, we'd better quickly do that or we're going to be losing it.
57:45:16              EECOM  We've got 3 or 4 minutes, FLIGHT.
57:45:18             FLIGHT  Yeah -
57:45:19                GNC  But the thing is, we want to pass to them - when he does see it go down. Or,
                             start going down. To get BATTERY A On.
57:45:24             FLIGHT  Is that -
57:45:25                GNC  To watch it.
57:45:25             FLIGHT  Now, you think we really want to spend that to keep the platform on? We're
                             using the entry batteries, too.
57:45:31              EECOM  What we take out of the battery we won't get back.
57:45:34             FLIGHT  That's right.
57:45:36             FLIGHT  No. Down to step 3. Down to step 3. All the way down to step 3.
57:45:49             FLIGHT  Yeah. Alright, okay. I just want to be sure we're sure we want to do that. And
                             quick, get a coarse align. CONTROL and TELMU, will the steps I got give me a
                             coarse align?
57:46:01             FLIGHT  CONTROL and TELMU -
57:46:02              TELMU  Negative, FLIGHT.
57:46:03            CONTROL  Go ahead; CONTROL here.
57:46:03             FLIGHT  Will those steps that we've passed so far get me a coarse align?
57:46:07              TELMU  Negative, that just gets you -
57:46:08            CONTROL  Standby.
57:46:09             FLIGHT  What else I gotta do to get a coarse align?
57:46:11            CONTROL  Standby, FLIGHT.
57:46:12              EECOM  Can we get those read up to the crew to step the power down? Of course, they
                             can power down everything, but here's a good start.
57:46:17  FLIGHT (off loop)  ?? the battery will drain as they power down?
57:46:19              EECOM  Roger.
57:46:20  FLIGHT (off loop)  Then it's just the IMU?
57:46:21              EECOM  That's roger.
57:46:22             FLIGHT  Okay, but we wanted to keep that up for a little while, I thought you just
                             said, with the BATTERY A. To get a coarse align on the LM.
57:46:28              EECOM  Well, maybe there's a bit of confusion here.
57:46:30             FLIGHT  Yeah. You just gave - you don't want to turn the IMU off until we get a coarse
                             align on the LM, right?
57:46:35              EECOM  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
57:46:35                GNC  That's affirm, FLIGHT. And we'll support a battery until you get that.
57:46:37             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, we want to power on down the CSM only. We want to put BAT A on -
                             about now? EECOM?
57:46:44              EECOM  Negative, not yet, FLIGHT. We'll let you know.
57:46:46             FLIGHT  We're going to put BATTERY A on - can you put it on while it's charging?
57:46:50       Maroon EECOM  No. We'll have to take the charge off.
57:46:51              EECOM  Negative.
57:46:52             FLIGHT  We want to take -
57:46:54       Maroon EECOM  We'll have to power down the charger and put it on MAIN A.
57:46:56             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:47:05              TELMU  The VHF is not required, FLIGHT.
57:47:08             FLIGHT  No VHF.
57:47:12             FLIGHT  Well.
57:47:26             FLIGHT  TELMU and CONTROL.
57:47:27            CONTROL  Go ahead.
57:47:28             FLIGHT  Look, it's unclear enough to me that I'm going to try to get a coarse align in
                             the LM. You know where we are, then, right, Will?
57:47:33             FLIGHT  Alright. Now, what do I have to do to get it?
57:47:35            CONTROL  Okay, I'm getting you that step right now, FLIGHT.
57:47:37             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
57:47:39             CAPCOM  Go ahead.
57:47:40             FLIGHT  When we get a little lower, we're going to have them pull BAT A off, and we'll
                             get him to put it on MAIN BUS A. We are then going to try to hold up the IMU
                             long enough to get a coarse align in the LM, and then we'll see whether we're
                             going to keep that coarse align up or not, but for right now we're running the
                             profiles and we'll have to determine that.
57:47:55             CAPCOM  Okay.
57:47:55             FLIGHT  That's the course of action, let Jack know that much.
57:47:57             CAPCOM  Okay. And he wants to know what he's going to see and what he should do when he
                             sees it happen to FUEL CELL 2.
57:48:04             FLIGHT  We're interested in keeping up the IMU and the lights, for him to see. That's
                             all.
57:48:10             FLIGHT  EECOM, GNC: everything else goes off? INCO?
57:48:15                GNC  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
57:48:16               INCO  Good plan.
57:48:16             FLIGHT  GNC? Anything else goes off?
57:48:17                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT.
57:48:19              EECOM  The only concern we have, FLIGHT, I just -
57:48:22             FLIGHT  Yeah, go ahead.
57:48:23              EECOM  - is the IMU heater power. And - for the CSM.
57:48:28             FLIGHT  Well? What do you want?
57:48:29              EECOM  Well, if you want to maintain the IMU for re-entry, we've got to have the
                             heater power on.
57:48:33             FLIGHT  How much is that?
57:48:34              EECOM  Standby, we'll take a look.
57:48:45              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM, we can take it off at any time.
57:48:47             FLIGHT  Take it off now, Jack.
57:48:49             FLIGHT  Take it off.
57:48:53             CAPCOM  Okay, I need some LM IMU align procedures.
57:48:56             FLIGHT  Yeah.
57:48:58              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:48:58             FLIGHT  Go.
57:48:59              EECOM  We need to go ahead and start that power down any time.
57:49:02             FLIGHT  Okay, do you want me to put BATTERY A on yet?
57:49:04       Maroon EECOM  Negative, FLIGHT.
57:49:04              EECOM  Negative, we'll give you a cue on that.
57:49:06             FLIGHT  Okay. Where do you want me to tell them to start, Clint?
57:49:09              EECOM  Keep your lights up and everything else has got to go.
57:49:12             FLIGHT  Everything else except the IMU.
57:49:13       Maroon EECOM  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
57:49:14              EECOM  Roger.
57:49:14             FLIGHT  Okay. Say again?
57:49:17              EECOM  That's affirm.
57:49:17             FLIGHT  How about the COMM? We don't have COMM yet with the LM.
57:49:20               INCO  As soon as you take that POWER AMPL off we're going to lose data.
57:49:23             FLIGHT  Okay, well let's - yes, let's be clear what we're doing here.
57:49:29             FLIGHT  We're discontinuing BATTERY A.
57:49:32             FLIGHT  Okay, so far I've got the IMU and the POWER AMPL up. Anything else?
57:49:40               INCO  That should do it, FLIGHT.
57:49:42             FLIGHT  How about COMM?
57:49:42               INCO  Leave the PCM up, too. Leave the COMM configuration alone.
57:49:45             FLIGHT  Yeah, leave the COMM configuration alone, CAPCOM, until we get COMM with the LM.
57:49:51              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
57:49:52             FLIGHT  Go.
57:49:53              TELMU  Okay, we've got one more - we want to make sure his SUIT FAN 1 is - our SUIT
                             FAN is positioned to 1.
57:50:01            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
57:50:03              TELMU  And the - on panel 11 we want ECS SUIT FAN 1 breaker closed.
57:50:08             FLIGHT  Okay, you want SUIT FAN number 1 on.
57:50:10              TELMU  Yeah.
57:50:10             FLIGHT  With the breaker. Go ahead, CONTROL.
57:50:12            CONTROL  Okay, FLIGHT, here's what we need.
57:50:13             FLIGHT  Alright, standby. CAPCOM, in the LM we need the SUIT FAN number 1 and its
                             circuit breaker on to get flow, and CONTROL's coming to me with the IMU
                             procedure. Go, CONTROL.
57:50:26            CONTROL  Panel 11. LGC/DSKY closed.
57:50:30             FLIGHT  That's the circuit breaker?
57:50:31            CONTROL  Yes.
57:50:32             FLIGHT  Panel 11 closed; yup.
57:50:34            CONTROL  Okay. Then go to Activation page 25, do steps 1, 2, and 3.
57:50:39             FLIGHT  1, 2, and 3? And what will that get us?
57:50:43            CONTROL  Okay, that'll get everything up and running and the platform turned on.
57:50:46             FLIGHT  And will that get us a coarse align?
57:50:47            CONTROL  Negative, that'll put you in P00.
57:50:48             FLIGHT  Okay, and then do -
57:50:49            CONTROL  Go to Activation 37.
57:50:51             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:50:51            CONTROL  Docked IMU coarse align procedure is there for you.
57:50:54             FLIGHT  Okay. Got it, CAPCOM?
57:50:55            CONTROL  Excuse me - 30. That's Activation 30, FLIGHT.
57:50:58             FLIGHT  Okay.
57:50:59             CAPCOM  Okay. I've got LGC/DSKY close, Activation 25 steps 1, 2, and 3, Activation 30.
57:51:05             FLIGHT  Okay, TELMU, one more question. Are we bringing up glycol flow here?
57:51:08              TELMU  We brought up circulation. We have not activated the boiler.
57:51:11             FLIGHT  Should we?
57:51:12              TELMU  I don't know; we're working on it, FLIGHT.
57:51:13             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:51:14              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:51:15             FLIGHT  Go.
57:51:16              EECOM  Okay, when we go through this power down when we bring BAT A up, we want them
                             to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure for fuel cell 2, just in case
                             the pressure should recover and we would still have a fuel cell later. Which is
                             not likely, but it's not going to cost us anything to do it except a little
                             time.
57:51:32             FLIGHT  FUEL CELL 2 shutdown; that closes the reactants?
57:51:35              EECOM  I'm - I'm sorry. Standby. Standby's the word.
57:51:38             FLIGHT  Yeah. Okay.
57:51:42             FLIGHT  You want me to put fuel cell number 2 on standby when? After we put BATTERY A
                             on?
57:51:47              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:51:48             FLIGHT  How close are we to doing that?
57:51:50              EECOM  Well, we're looking for it any time now.
57:51:52             FLIGHT  Alright.
57:52:04             FLIGHT  Have we got anybody over in the LM yet, Jack? Can you tell? Somebody climbed
                             over there? They're both over there?
57:52:08             CAPCOM  Yeah, we've got them both over there, and they've just taken the procedure for
                             the activation of the IMU.
57:52:16             FLIGHT  Yeah. Okay. I don't know how long we'll be able to keep that up, but at least
                             we'll have something.
57:52:22             CAPCOM  Okay, and what other things you've got to go up that I missed while I was
                             talking?
57:52:38             CAPCOM  Have we given them the signal on the battery yet?
57:52:44             FLIGHT  Uh, no.
57:52:45              EECOM  Negative on that.
57:52:46       Maroon EECOM  About another 20 psi, FLIGHT.
57:52:48             FLIGHT  GNC, FLIGHT. What do you want on the heater? Circuit breakers?
57:52:51                GNC  We're still working on that, FLIGHT. We're trying to get it - find out if we
                             can power them down and bring the platform up later on, whether we've really
                             got a problem there or not.
57:52:59             FLIGHT  Alright. Go ahead. We'll have BMAGs.
57:53:02                GNC  Roger.
57:53:19              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:53:20             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:53:21              EECOM  We can turn the GLYCOL PUMP off anytime.
57:53:29              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:53:30             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:53:30              EECOM  BYPASS on the primary rads.
57:53:32       Maroon EECOM  Turn the GLYCOL PUMP off.
57:53:34             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, he can turn the GLYCOL PUMP off in the CSM.
57:53:38             CAPCOM  Okay.
57:53:39              EECOM  BYPASS on the rads.
57:53:40             FLIGHT  BYPASS on the rads, and then turn the pump off, huh?
57:53:43              EECOM  Roger.
57:53:43       Maroon EECOM  In that order.
57:53:43             FLIGHT  Okay. BYPASS, and then PUMP off.
57:53:46              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
57:53:47             FLIGHT  Go.
57:53:47              TELMU  Okay, we should be okay thermally in the LM vehicle until we get telemetry, and
                             we'll watch it until we tell you to turn on the boiler.
57:53:57             FLIGHT  Okay, fair enough. You can look at TM before you tell me about the sublimators.
                             Thank you.
57:54:00              TELMU  Roger that.
57:54:01             FLIGHT  BYPASS and the GLYCOL PUMP coming off.
57:54:13             CAPCOM  Okay, FLIGHT. Anything else I missed while I was talking to them there?
57:54:16             FLIGHT  Uh, I don't know, Jack. I haven't been following everything you've said, you
                             did tell them that we're going to be putting BATTERY A on to keep the IMU up. I
                             don't know how much time we've got here; another 20psi was the last I heard.
57:54:27             CAPCOM  Yeah, and I'm standing by for a mark on that.
57:54:30             FLIGHT  Yeah. How much power have we got left on in the CSM, EECOM? We haven't got a
                             lot on -
57:54:35              EECOM  We've got about 40 amps.
57:54:36             FLIGHT  Okay. What else can we take off right now?
57:54:39              EECOM  We passed the list to CAPCOM while we had the IMU heaters - IMU on it.
                             Everything on that list but the IMU.
57:54:46             FLIGHT  Yeah. Got it, Jack? You want them to start powering that stuff down, right
                             Clint?
57:54:52              EECOM  Roger.
57:54:53             FLIGHT  Okay, Jack. Everything but that IMU.
57:55:13              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
57:55:13             FLIGHT  Go.
57:55:14              EECOM  O₂ TANK 2 FANS off.
57:55:18             FLIGHT  You're giving up there, huh?
57:55:19              EECOM  Giving up.
57:55:19             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, O₂ FANS 2 off.
57:55:23             CAPCOM  Say again, please?
57:55:24             FLIGHT  O₂ TANK 2 FANS can go off. There's nothing happening there.
57:55:28              EECOM  That's confirmed. All FUEL CELL PUMPs off, FLIGHT. That's 1, 2, 3.
57:55:31             FLIGHT  You want to shut 2 down, now?
57:55:33       Maroon EECOM  That's affirm.
57:55:33              EECOM  Just the pumps. Just turn the pumps off.
57:55:35             FLIGHT  Oh. Okay. All FUEL CELL PUMPs off, CAPCOM. That may be a verify.
57:55:39             CAPCOM  Okay, verify all FUEL CELL PUMPs off, and -
57:55:41             FLIGHT  Fans off.
                     CAPCOM  - fans off in O₂ TANK 2.
57:55:43             FLIGHT  Yeah.
57:56:02               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO, we have the LM downlink coming in.
57:56:10             CAPCOM  We don't want them fans and heaters in TANK 1, do we?
57:56:14             FLIGHT  EECOM, you don't want anything on in TANK 1, do you? Or do you?
57:56:17              EECOM  Roger, we want them all on.
57:56:19             FLIGHT  Leave them all on in TANK 1, CAPCOM.
57:56:20              EECOM  That's affirmative.
57:56:21             CAPCOM  Okay.
57:56:27             FLIGHT  I'm still seeing 40 amps. What all have we got on there, EECOM? CMC? IMU?
57:56:32              EECOM  Roger, FLIGHT.
57:56:33             FLIGHT  And some COMM.
57:56:34              EECOM  IMU and CMC still up right now.
57:56:35             FLIGHT  And SUIT FAN.
57:56:38             FLIGHT  Now, EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:56:39              EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:56:40             FLIGHT  Look, I'm worried about shutting this thing down so that it's safe when we want
                             to repower it from the entry batteries.
57:56:45              EECOM  Roger. We don't - we're going to ask you to bring up BAT A whenever we see the
                             voltage begin to drop off.
57:56:49             FLIGHT  I understand that, I still want some kind of closeout configuration. Okay?
57:56:52              EECOM  Affirmative.
57:56:53             FLIGHT  GNC, same with you. And I haven't heard from you on the heaters yet, on the IMU.
57:56:57                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. Preliminary look at it, looks like we can pull all the circuit
                             breakers - power on the heaters. But we're still trying to get a handle on it.
57:57:04             FLIGHT  We may well have no choice.
57:57:05                GNC  That's a fact.
57:57:07             FLIGHT  I don't know - how many amps do they take?
57:57:09                GNC  10.
57:57:10             FLIGHT  Aw! 10 amps!?
57:57:11                GNC  Roger.
57:57:12             FLIGHT  I got - I'm looking at a hundred and - I'm looking at - fif, sixt, 80 hours!
57:57:16                GNC  Okay. Roger.
57:57:18             FLIGHT  That's academic!
57:57:19                GNC  I understand.
57:57:20             CAPCOM  And FLIGHT, CAPCOM.
57:57:22             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:57:23             CAPCOM  Okay, I've got a procedure for COMM activation; 28 on the panel here. It came
                             from somewhere, is this something you want to go up?
57:57:30             FLIGHT  INCO, is that the COMM activation in the LM?
57:57:31               INCO  Negative, FLIGHT, the COMM activation is the same as you've got over there,
                             except we want to change to normal VOICE when he gets squared away. I gave him
                             some steerable angles in case we want to activate it. So I have it - and that's
                             the procedure.
57:57:41             FLIGHT  Can we go on the OMNI right now?
57:57:43               INCO  Roger. As we come up on the Goldstone with the 210 we'll be alright.
57:57:46            NETWORK  We have AOS with the 210 now, FLIGHT.
57:57:48             FLIGHT  We'll stick with the OMNI, yeah, Jack. So don't do anything with that.
57:57:51            NETWORK  FLIGHT, we have OMNI data on the LM right now.
57:57:53             FLIGHT  We have AOS on the LM.
57:57:56                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
57:57:56             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:57:57                GNC  We've got a better number on that heater power; it only draws about 0.8 amps.
                             So we'd like to leave that up.
57:58:04            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
57:58:05             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
57:58:06            CONTROL  The temp looks good. 129.9.
57:58:06             FLIGHT  Okay. 0.8 amps for the rest of the mission is going to cost me 64 amp-hours.
                             GNC, FLIGHT.
57:58:16                GNC  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:58:17             FLIGHT  It's going to cost me 64 amp-hours.
57:58:22             FLIGHT  I can't afford that! Can't I bring it back up without them? Is that absolutely
                             known?
57:58:29                GNC  Yeah, I think you can, FLIGHT, but the platform's way off -
57:58:33             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
57:58:34              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
57:58:35       Maroon EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
57:58:35             FLIGHT  Turn around here a minute. He's talking about the IMU heater, it's going to
                             cost me 0.8 amps, I'm - 142 hours at landing - I'm 80 hours away. That's 64
                             amp-hours.
57:58:47              EECOM  Forever?
57:58:48             FLIGHT  Can you hack that out of the entry batteries?
57:58:50              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
57:58:51              EECOM  We might hack it transferring power back from the LM to the CSM, but we can't
                             hack it on the batteries.
57:58:56       Maroon EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM. Since it's only 0.8 amps let's hack it for a little while here.
                             Then we -
57:58:59              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
57:59:00             FLIGHT  Go ahead, TELMU.
57:59:00              TELMU  Okay, FLIGHT. It looks like they are still on low-volt taps. We need to get the
                             Activation step 12 substep 3 and go to high taps on the LM batteries, 1 through
                             4.
57:59:13             FLIGHT  Got it, Jack?
57:59:14             CAPCOM  You want the high taps on the batteries, 1 through 4?
57:59:17              TELMU  Roger, that's Activation 12 step 3. Looks like they're still on low taps.
58:00:00             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, did you give them that about the high taps?
58:00:03             CAPCOM  I gave them that about the high taps and they're going through it -
58:00:09              TELMU  FLIGHT, looks like we're going to high taps.
58:00:11             FLIGHT  Alright.

58:01:29             FLIGHT  All the way through that, Jack, that's what he means.
58:01:30              GUIDO  That's affirm.
58:01:44              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
58:01:45             FLIGHT  Go.
58:01:45              EECOM  Okay, we expect to put the battery on any time now. We're still going to give
                             you a cue on it.
58:01:50             FLIGHT  Okay.

58:02:05              EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
58:02:06             FLIGHT  While they're working the problem, do you want me to leave BATTERY A on MAIN
                             BUS A?
58:02:13              EECOM  When we give you the cue, we'll put -
58:02:13             FLIGHT  For that IMU heater?
58:02:17             FLIGHT  Is that what your plan is?
58:02:18              EECOM  Until we get - until we get through to the LM, that's right.
58:02:21             FLIGHT  Okay. Now, doesn't - GNC, I wanted to hear from both you guys whether you want
                             to leave that on the whole time, but we can stand 0.8 for now on the entry bat.
58:02:30                GNC  Roger, FLIGHT. We're - we feel like we'd probably be able to power it down.
58:02:33             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:02:34                GNC  Preliminary look at it.

58:02:45            CONTROL  Roger.
58:02:46             FLIGHT  But remind me again in a minute, CONTROL.
58:02:47            CONTROL  Okay.
58:03:23             CAPCOM  Are we still awaiting the mark on BAT A?
58:03:26             FLIGHT  I don't know. EECOM, how far away from BAT A?
58:03:28              EECOM  FLIGHT, any time now, but the voltage is still up. We'll cue you.
58:03:32             FLIGHT  Okay, well, I'm afraid it'll go fast, aren't you?
58:03:35              EECOM  Well, we - it'll go pretty fast when it gets there.
58:03:38             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, you primed Jack about BAT A, haven't you?
58:03:42             CAPCOM  I told him we'd give him a mark on BAT A. He wanted to know what to watch for.
                             He'll see the voltage drop but we'll give him the mark.
58:03:48       Maroon EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
58:03:49             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
58:03:50       Maroon EECOM  O₂ to N₂ ∆P is dropping; let's turn BATTERY A on.
58:03:52             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, BATTERY A on.
58:03:58             FLIGHT  Tell him to hurry.
58:04:00             FLIGHT  He got it. Good boy.
58:04:09             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, copy the numbers.
58:04:14             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, copy those numbers.

58:04:35             FLIGHT  You got BATTERY A on there, EECOM? 11 amps.
58:04:37              EECOM  That's affirmative, FLIGHT. It's on.
58:04:50             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.
58:04:51              GUIDO  Go, FLIGHT.
58:04:51             FLIGHT  Let me know when they're all done and you've got what you want in the LM,
                             because I want to get that CSM powered down.
58:04:56              GUIDO  Okay. We can't watch the LM, FLIGHT, we don't have the HIGH BIT RATE.
58:04:59             FLIGHT  Okay, but from the voice.
58:05:00              GUIDO  Okay. Roger.
58:05:01               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
58:05:02             FLIGHT  Go.
58:05:03               INCO  We can get HIGH BIT RATE from the LM.
58:05:07             FLIGHT  Does it cost me any power?
58:05:08               INCO  No. We'd like for him to go to panel 12; we'd like to go FUNCTION switch to
                             VOICE, and HIGH BIT RATE on PCM.
58:05:15             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, got that?
58:05:16       Maroon EECOM  INCO, EECOM. Meet me on number 1.
58:05:17             CAPCOM  Say again, please?
58:05:18             FLIGHT  They want to go to HIGH BIT RATE in the LM. Won't cost us any power. And they
                             can tell a little more.
58:05:41             CAPCOM  And, FLIGHT, we checking his arithmetic? On the -
58:05:45             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, arithmetic?
58:05:48              GUIDO  Go, FLIGHT.
58:05:49             FLIGHT  How's the arithmetic?
58:05:52              GUIDO  Standby, we'll check it.
58:05:58       Maroon EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
58:05:58             FLIGHT  Go.
58:05:59       Maroon EECOM  If we can get LOW BIT RATE with the POWER AMPL off, let's turn the PRIMARY
                             POWER AMPL off on the COMM system. There's no sense in -
58:06:04             FLIGHT  INCO? Can we do that?
58:06:06               INCO  Yes. Let's try it.
58:06:07             FLIGHT  CSM POWER AMPL off?
58:06:09               INCO  LOW BIT RATE. DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
58:06:11             FLIGHT  You need him to do that?
58:06:12               INCO  Yes.
58:06:13             FLIGHT  Okay, CAPCOM. LOW BIT RATE. DOWN VOICE BACKUP, and POWER AMPL OFF in the CSM.
58:06:20             CAPCOM  Okay.
58:06:21       Maroon EECOM  INCO, EECOM. Meet me on number 1.

58:06:27             FLIGHT  Go.
58:06:28              TELMU  We need to get the SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.
58:06:30             FLIGHT  Yes.
58:06:39             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, LM: SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.
58:06:49             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, how's that arithmetic?
58:06:51              GUIDO  It looks good, FLIGHT.
58:06:52             FLIGHT  The arithmetic is go?
58:06:54              GUIDO  Roger.
58:06:55             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, the arithmetic's good.
58:06:58             FLIGHT  Does that mean we've got an alignment now?
58:07:00              GUIDO  A coarse align.
58:07:01        Other GUIDO  We've got a coarse align, FLIGHT.
58:07:02             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM -
58:07:10             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:07:30             FLIGHT  As soon as we've got the alignment and we're finished with it we're going CMC
                             OFF, IMU OFF, we'll leave the heater circuit breakers on powered from - BATTERY
                             A. Until you tell me whether we need to keep them up or not.
58:07:44             CAPCOM  How come we're getting so much noise on the COMM?
58:07:47             FLIGHT  Don't know. INCO?
58:07:50               INCO  We'd like them to do a COMMAND RESET on the CSM so we can get the LOW BIT RATE.
58:07:57             FLIGHT  I thought we just told them that.
58:07:58               INCO  We did, but the way the commands work and everything -
58:08:02             FLIGHT  Alright. They're in the middle of it, I'll give it to them in a minute.
58:08:05               INCO  Okay.
58:08:59             FLIGHT  We're turning off some more of the instrumentation, gentlemen.
58:09:02             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, have they got the fine align down to where you want it, yet?
58:09:05              GUIDO  FLIGHT, we need him to read the angles to us. We've lost CSM data; we don't
                             know what the CSM got on the 06 20.
58:09:13             FLIGHT  Okay, you really need that, huh?
58:09:15              GUIDO  Right.
58:09:15             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, they need a VERB 06 NOUN 20 on the CSM. We lost it.
58:09:26             FLIGHT  Here they are.
58:09:49              GUIDO  Copy, FLIGHT.
58:09:50             FLIGHT  Yup.
58:10:06             FLIGHT  You got everything you need, GUIDANCE?
58:10:12              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
58:10:12             FLIGHT  Go.
58:10:13              EECOM  We're ready to go ahead and power down the CMC now.
58:10:15             FLIGHT  Wait a minute. I want to be sure the guidance is alright.
58:10:17              EECOM  Okay.
58:10:27             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, can one of you tell me if you've got everything you need?
58:10:30              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE, we got everything.
58:10:35        Other GUIDO  We're working on it now, FLIGHT.
58:10:36             FLIGHT  Now - my question really is: when can I turn the CMC off? Are we that far
                             enough through the procedure that we can turn it off? Yes or no, that's all I'm
                             -
58:10:45              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT. We are, FLIGHT.
58:10:47             FLIGHT  You are.
58:10:47              GUIDO  Right.
58:10:48             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:10:49               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
58:10:50             FLIGHT  Go.
58:10:50               INCO  If you get us that COMMAND RESET we'll get some data; we're blind here.
58:10:53             FLIGHT  Okay. Well - in the CSM, you mean?
58:10:55               INCO  That's affirmative.
58:10:55             FLIGHT  We're turning it down anyway, right now, Ed.
58:10:59             FLIGHT  CONTROL and GUIDANCE, one more time. You've got everything you need through to
                             fine align and we can proceed to power down the IMU in the CSM, correct?
58:11:05              GUIDO  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
58:11:06            CONTROL  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
58:11:07             FLIGHT  Okay, and we'll leave the heaters on. Heater power circuit breaker on in the
                             CSM.
58:11:10            CONTROL  Check LM LDG RDR heater breaker also.
58:11:13             FLIGHT  Yeah. CAPCOM, for the CSM. We've got the fine align data and everything is set
                             up so therefore we can start powering down the CMC and the IMU. For now leave
                             the heater circuit breaker on, and the BATTERY A on the bus like it is. We're
                             running that IMU heater to ground to see whether we need to leave that on or
                             not. And here's the - paper -
58:11:32                GNC  FLIGHT, GNC.
58:11:33              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM. 
58:11:34                GNC  We got the go ahead to turn the heater power off.
58:11:36             FLIGHT  Say again?
58:11:37                GNC  IMU HEATER power to OFF.
58:11:38             FLIGHT  And we'll still have it?
58:11:40                GNC  That's right. We feel that we have a real good chance of bringing the platform
                             up in good shape.
58:11:43             FLIGHT  Now, do you want more time to debate it? I'm willing to give you 0.8 of an amp.
58:11:47                GNC  I don't really know how much debate really needs to be done on that.
58:11:50              EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM. We need some data. We need to get the LOW BIT RATE - I think we
                             need COMMAND RESET.
58:11:57             FLIGHT  CS - CAPCOM, CSM COMMAND RESET, and then give them those instructions. We've
                             got enough, we might as well save what we can on the battery now, and power
                             down.
58:12:05             CAPCOM  You want the CMC and IMU powered down?
58:12:07             FLIGHT  Yup.
58:12:08             CAPCOM  And heater circuit breaker - heaters off. Off on the -
58:12:11             FLIGHT  And all the heaters, etc.
58:12:13              EECOM  And COMMAND RESET.
58:12:14             FLIGHT  And COMMAND RESET before they -
58:12:16             CAPCOM  And you want BAT A, huh?
58:12:17             FLIGHT  Yeah.
58:13:04              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
58:13:05             FLIGHT  Go.
58:13:05              TELMU  Okay, we've been watching glycol temps and I guess we'd better go ahead and
                             crank up the water boiler. This is Activation 20 - - Activation -
58:13:16             FLIGHT  Listen. Listen.
58:13:18              TELMU  And Activation 21 step 3.
58:13:36             FLIGHT  Do you want to leave BATTERY A on? EECOM? Is that still the story? For how long?
58:13:39              EECOM  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
58:13:40             FLIGHT  How long will you want to do that?

58:13:52             FLIGHT  Alright.
58:14:03             FLIGHT  Yeah. Before we turn his thrusters off in the CSM, CAPCOM, you'd better verify
                             they've got some control in the LM.
58:14:10            CONTROL  FLIGHT -

58:18:49       Maroon EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
58:18:50             FLIGHT  Go ahead - that was to the - that was for the CSM, that FDAI.
58:19:03             FLIGHT  And for the LM, CAPCOM, we need RCS heaters on, they need to pressurize the RCS
                             to have control. And for the water sublimator, Activation 20 and 21 step 3.
58:19:13             CAPCOM  Okay. I gave them 20 and 21 step 3 already -
58:19:15             FLIGHT  Okay.
                     CAPCOM  - and you want RCS heaters on in -
58:19:19             FLIGHT  Yeah, RCS pressurize - we didn't tell him to pull the FDAI in the LM.
58:19:23             CAPCOM  No, that was the CSM.
58:19:24             FLIGHT  Yeah. Does he understand that? Does that - Jim, does - has he -
58:19:48             FLIGHT  CONTROL, do you want them to power the balls up and RCS?
58:19:52            CONTROL  Definitely the RCS, FLIGHT.
58:19:54             FLIGHT  Well, they need the ball to tell where they are.
58:19:56            CONTROL  Roger.
58:19:56             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, yeah, get a ball up in - one ball up and RCS heaters. And press.
58:20:01            CONTROL  And they need to have all of the circuit breakers in for the ISOL VALVES and
                             the main SOVs, FLIGHT. On panels 11 and 16.
58:20:09             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:20:11             CAPCOM  Okay, in an orderly fashion, please. Ready. What you want, FLIGHT?
58:20:15             FLIGHT  Okay, how's the CSM? Anything for the CSM?
58:20:20       Maroon EECOM  FLIGHT, EECOM.
58:20:20             FLIGHT  Go.
58:20:21       Maroon EECOM  I think we're ready to power the main buses down. If everybody's ready.
58:20:24              GUIDO  They don't have attitude control in the LM, FLIGHT.
58:20:26             FLIGHT  Let's be sure we have control in the LM. Although he's probably out of jets
                             right now. GNC, you got anything for the CSM?
58:20:32                GNC  Negative, FLIGHT.
58:20:33             FLIGHT  Okay, CAPCOM. For the LM, we think he ought to have an eight-ball, and we ought
                             to get his RCS heaters on, his RCS pressurized, and he needs to get all his
                             circuit breakers on 11 and 16 closed for control.
58:20:44            CONTROL  Yeah, and Jack, what we're talking about is the QUAD HEATER breakers, the MAIN
                             SOVs, and ISOL VALVE breakers on panels 11 and 16.
58:20:53             CAPCOM  Don't you have an Activation page I can just tell them to turn to?
58:20:57            CONTROL  Yeah, if you want to close all those dadgum breakers. On that page. And then he
                             can go back and open them all up later, the ones he doesn't need. That's
                             Activation 22 and 23.
58:21:22             FLIGHT  EECOM, GNC, copy his question?
58:21:25              EECOM  Negative, FLIGHT.
58:21:28             FLIGHT  Jack wants to know how we wanted to proceed with the SCS. Go ahead, John.
58:21:45             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT, you giving us something for getting your RCS up?
58:21:48            CONTROL  Yes sir, FLIGHT.
58:21:49             FLIGHT  Hurry up, will you please?
58:21:50            CONTROL  Yeah.
58:21:51             FLIGHT  We've just got a lot of traffic for the CAPCOM.
58:21:52            CONTROL  Wilco.
58:22:17                GNC  Okay, FLIGHT, GNC. The CMC and the IMU are completely powered down at this time.
58:22:21             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:22:42             FLIGHT  Copy all that, CONTROL?
58:22:43            CONTROL  FLIGHT, put the TCA breakers in last. The TCA breakers in last.
58:22:48             FLIGHT  Okay. TCA breakers in last.
58:23:07             FLIGHT  Yup. That works.
58:23:08            CONTROL  Copy, FLIGHT.
58:23:33             FLIGHT  Okay. CONTROL, do you understand the configuration we're getting into?
58:23:37            CONTROL  Say again, FLIGHT?
58:23:38             FLIGHT  Do you understand the configuration we're getting into?
58:23:41            CONTROL  Right now, as I understand it, we're getting into a PGNS attitude control mode -
58:23:45             FLIGHT  Okay -
                    CONTROL  - it'll be ATTITUDE HOLD.
58:23:47             FLIGHT  Okay. My point is - let's be careful with what we're telling the CAPCOM to do
                             here; try to give him as clear instructions by switches or Activation pages as
                             we can, okay? Now -
58:23:57            CONTROL  Okay, but the circuit breakers -
58:23:58             FLIGHT  I know.
                    CONTROL  - are all botched together on these charts, FLIGHT -
58:24:00             FLIGHT  I know. Okay, you're ready to power down the inverters, the BATTERY RELAY BUS,
                             and you're ready to pull the entry battery off.
58:24:07       Maroon EECOM  That's right. Now, that's not all completely configured to do it, but I think
                             we've got to get off entry battery and then do it with voice, FLIGHT. Through
                             the LM. COMM. That's going to kill COMM and everything.
58:24:16             FLIGHT  Yeah. You're ready to do that. Is everybody ready to kill COMM in the CSM? GNC?
58:24:21                GNC  Go, FLIGHT.
58:24:22             FLIGHT  You ready to kill COMM in the CSM?

58:24:31              GUIDO  Roger.
58:24:36             FLIGHT  Yeah; I want to be sure we've got control somewhere. I'm not satisfied we do
                             yet. Attitude control.
58:24:49             CAPCOM  FLIGHT, CAPCOM.
58:24:50             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
58:24:51             CAPCOM  Okay. We haven't got ourselves into a position here where we have no attitude
                             control in either vehicle, have we?
58:24:57             FLIGHT  I'm waiting to see when we get attitude control in the LM. Would they - would
                             you ask them to call us when they have attitude control in the LM, and then
                             we'll power the inverters, et cetera down in the CSM?
58:25:07            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
58:25:08             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
58:25:08            CONTROL  Okay, once they get control established, we're going to do some setup work as
                             far as loading the DAP to get his -
58:25:12             FLIGHT  Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.
58:25:15             FLIGHT  I just want to get attitude control first.
58:25:17            CONTROL  Roger.  He's had to put his PGNS MODE control switch to ATT HOLD.
58:25:21             FLIGHT  Oh yeah. Okay.
58:25:38  FLIGHT (off loop)  Say again?
58:25:46             CAPCOM  Hey FLIGHT, they don't have attitude control in the - we don't have CM/SM -

58:28:42             FLIGHT  Alright.
58:28:46              TELMU  Okay, FLIGHT, we've got a procedure here for the AC coming at you.
58:28:59             FLIGHT  CAP - he needs AC for the eight-ball - CAPCOM. We need to get AC powered up in
                             the LM. I'm sure they know the procedure, but there it is.
58:29:20             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
58:29:21              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.

                             boxes to make sure everything's configured correctly for attitude control?
58:34:49             FLIGHT  Yeah. I'd like to be sure the LM is okay while we power the CSM down, now.
58:35:01             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:35:01             CAPCOM  Okay - yeah, I heard him holler up the tunnel.
58:35:02             FLIGHT  Yeah. CONTROL, are you okay?
58:35:04            CONTROL  Yeah, we've got one TCP switch firing -
58:35:06             FLIGHT  Okay. But are you okay?
58:35:08            CONTROL  Well, we look okay now, and we'll need another DSKY entry here very shortly to
                             inhibit our upward-firing jets.
58:35:13             FLIGHT  Alright. TELMU, are you okay?
58:35:16              TELMU  Roger, FLIGHT, we're doing pretty good. I've got to get with you in a little
                             while on -
58:35:18             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      TELMU  - high ASCENT O₂ pressure.
58:35:21             FLIGHT  Yeah, okay. GUIDANCE, you okay in the LM?
58:35:23              GUIDO  We're good, FLIGHT.
58:35:25             FLIGHT  Okay. GNC and EECOM. We're going to power down. You ready?
58:35:27                GNC  We're ready, FLIGHT.
58:35:28              EECOM  EECOM. Go.
58:35:37             CAPCOM  Okay, FLIGHT. They've got attitude control in the LM now. What do you want to
                             do with the CSM?
58:35:41             FLIGHT  Okay, here it is, right behind you, Jack. For powering it down. There's the
                             paper.
58:36:11             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT.
58:36:12              EECOM  Go, FLIGHT.
58:36:13             FLIGHT  Are there any switches you want in the off position before we power down? Like,
                             for example, compressors or anything?
58:36:18       Maroon EECOM  No, FLIGHT. Let's just power - this down, we'll fix it later -
58:36:19             FLIGHT  Okay. Okay.
58:37:55             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
58:37:57              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
58:37:57             CAPCOM  You want them to open-circuit fuel cell 2, right?
58:38:00       Maroon EECOM  That's affirm, if he hasn't done it.
58:38:02              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
58:38:15             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
58:38:17             CAPCOM  Go, FLIGHT.
58:38:18             FLIGHT  We okay there with them? Right now?
58:38:23             CAPCOM  Okay, open -
58:38:29       Maroon EECOM  Just close the REAC valves, FLIGHT.
58:38:32             FLIGHT  Just close them. Just close the REACs.
58:38:54            NETWORK  FLIGHT, NETWORK.
58:38:55             FLIGHT  Go.
58:38:55            NETWORK  We lost both CPs. We'll be up in a minute.
58:38:58             FLIGHT  Hurry up.
58:39:01             FLIGHT  We just lost data in the building, gentlemen. It's the CPs. Standby.
58:39:10             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
58:39:12              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
58:39:12             FLIGHT  My problem, next, when I get around to it with you guys, is going to be what
                             configuration to power down to.
58:39:19              TELMU  Roger.
58:39:20             FLIGHT  At the present time I'm thinking I'd like to keep the LM IMU up through the
                             burn -
58:39:29             FLIGHT  - we're up on the CPs. But that's about as far as I've got it through.
                             Everybody's running power profiles, and Jim McDivitt's people have those set of
                             numbers right now.
58:39:40              TELMU  Okay, FLIGHT, we're working on it.
58:40:01             FLIGHT  EECOM, are you all the way down yet?
58:40:04              EECOM  Looks like the inverter went off, FLIGHT.
58:40:06             FLIGHT  So he's in the process. Alright.
58:40:22             FLIGHT  Copy, CAPCOM. Thank you.
58:40:37             FLIGHT  Okay, look, gentlemen -
58:40:43             FLIGHT  We - good LM data? EECOM? TELMU.
58:40:47              TELMU  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
58:40:48            NETWORK  - here it is.
58:40:48             FLIGHT  Yeah, we have it.
58:40:49               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO, we've got a problem.
58:41:02             FLIGHT  We going to have good data here for a while?
58:41:05               INCO  In and out, FLIGHT. We've got a different problem. By turning off the CSM, we
                             end up without any good tracking data. There's no way we can get any tracking
                             data. That LM data is biased because of the uplink shift, and data select
                             cannot use that tracking data.
58:41:21               INCO  Consequently, somewhere in here we're going to have to bring up some kind of
                             tracking on the CSM again.
58:41:26             FLIGHT  FDO, FLIGHT.
58:41:27                FDO  Go, FLIGHT.
58:41:28             FLIGHT  Would you figure that out? We're well clear now of the Moon, right?
58:41:33                FDO  Roger that. As far as we can tell we are, FLIGHT.
58:41:36             FLIGHT  And we need to - why can't we track this LM? Why is this LM interference - this
                             IU interference -
58:41:42               INCO  That's right, because we had to bias off that frequency to change it down,
                             making a bias in the data; that data's no good.
58:41:48             FLIGHT  Is it possible to go back to the original and just leave this -
58:41:51               INCO  We already tried it, FLIGHT. We tried it already. Doesn't work.
58:41:54             FLIGHT  Okay, Ed. Thank you.
58:41:57             FLIGHT  Mrrh. Okay.
58:42:01             FLIGHT  Okay, everybody, look. We've got a number of long-range problems right now. We
                             have the burn to do, which is at about 79 hours: 28 hours from now. And that's
                             one business. We have to get the track up as we need it to take care of that
                             burn. Hopefully we won't need to do too much with that, although I don't know
                             how many amps that's going to take. However, right now, I want to be sure that
                             we get the whole situation stabilized with the LM and the CSM. We've got to
                             start bringing the LM power down some, and get any non-required stuff off the
                             line so we don't use up any of these amp-hours that we don't need to give away.
                             And I want you to pay attention to the configuration we're currently in and get
                             the people offline working on the longer-range problems, especially the
                             lifeboat problems now associated with the LM.
58:42:45             FLIGHT  You know, LiOH, etc.
58:42:49             FLIGHT  Let's get all that configured. But right now I want the guys who are in the
                             room to concentrate on keeping this thing right now going along all right, and
                             watching it.
58:42:59             FLIGHT  Alright.
58:43:02             CAPCOM  FLIGHT, CAPCOM.
58:43:02             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
58:43:03             CAPCOM  Okay, my gyro torquing angles still good?
58:43:07             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, are those gyro torques still good?
58:43:09              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT.
58:43:10             FLIGHT  And the crew wants those?
58:43:11              GUIDO  Roger. We ought to go ahead and fine align the platform.
58:43:13             FLIGHT  There you go, CAPCOM.
58:43:15             CAPCOM  Okay, and on these - Fred asked the question, he'd like to pull some circuit
                             breakers on displays and have us watch them; is he clear to do that?
58:43:24             FLIGHT  CONTROL and TELMU.
58:43:25            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
58:43:26             FLIGHT  Do you have good data there, and we can pull the display circuit breakers in
                             the cockpit?
58:43:31            CONTROL  Roger, FLIGHT. Just about ready.
58:43:32             FLIGHT  Okay. Yes, gentlemen.
58:43:33             CAPCOM  They want you to tell me what circuit breakers to pull, and I want them -
                             defined as to panel and so forth, just like we did in the TCP, so there's no
                             misunderstanding there. Okay?
58:43:45             FLIGHT  CONTROL?
58:43:46            CONTROL  Yeah, we copy.
58:43:47             FLIGHT  Once you get them, TELMU.
58:44:22            CONTROL  That's Activation 40, FLIGHT.
58:44:24             FLIGHT  Activation 40, Jack.
58:45:31             CAPCOM  Okay, FLIGHT. Do you want them to proceed with IMU fine align as outlined on
                             page 40?
58:45:36             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE?
58:45:36              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT. That's what we want them to do.
58:45:38             FLIGHT  Affirm.
58:45:52             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT. Did you up with those circuit breaker labels?
58:45:55              TELMU  FLIGHT, we're working on them right now.
58:45:57             FLIGHT  What do you mean? Don't you know what the circuit breaker numbers - names are?
58:46:00              TELMU  Yeah, there's a whole slew of them -
58:46:02             FLIGHT  Oh, okay.
                      TELMU  - what we're going to do is just give you a page of them with -
58:46:04             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:46:04              TELMU  - breakers: open circled.
58:46:06             CAPCOM  Okay, I'm looking for panel - system - breaker name.
58:46:11             FLIGHT  Yeah, they're going to give you a picture of the panel with -
58:46:13              TELMU  We're just going to give you a picture -
                     FLIGHT  - them circled -
                      TELMU  - with the breakers circled.
58:46:17             CAPCOM  Beautiful.
58:46:19             CAPCOM  Do it just like TCP if you can.
58:46:26             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
58:46:27              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
58:46:27             FLIGHT  While you're doing that, have somebody else figuring out what we might take off
                             here to save some current.
58:46:33              TELMU  Okay.
58:46:35             FLIGHT  CONTROL, same with you.
58:46:37            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
58:46:38             FLIGHT  Same with you - we're going to want to save some power here, so -
58:46:41            CONTROL  Right. We're working on it.
58:46:42             FLIGHT  Figure out some suggestions.
58:47:31             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
58:47:32             CAPCOM  Go, FLIGHT.
58:47:33             FLIGHT  Jack, would you let me the conclusion of whatever discussions you guys had
                             about - alignments? When you get - come to one?
58:47:39             CAPCOM  Yessir.
58:47:40             FLIGHT  Thank you.
58:47:42  FLIGHT (off loop)  Okay. I'll wait until you -
58:49:22           RECOVERY  FLIGHT, RECOVERY. Did you call?
58:49:24             FLIGHT  No.
58:50:39              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
58:50:40             FLIGHT  Go.
58:50:41              GUIDO  Okay, we'd like to have an E-MOD DUMP for the LM, FLIGHT.
58:50:44             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:50:45              GUIDO  Yeah, we're ready for it at the site.
58:50:47             FLIGHT  Okay. We'll let - give them a little while, here.
58:50:49              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
58:50:50             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
58:50:51              TELMU  Okay, we're tracking a little problem here on ASCENT O₂ TANK 2 -
58:50:53             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, remind me of that in a little bit.
58:50:55              GUIDO  Yessir.
58:50:56             FLIGHT  ASCENT TANK 2, what is -
58:50:57              TELMU  The pressure is up higher than it should be, what we need to do is open ASCENT -
58:51:04             FLIGHT  Before you go through the valves, what are you trying to accomplish?
58:51:07              TELMU  We're trying to use the ASCENT TANK 2 pressure instead of the descent tank.
58:51:12             FLIGHT  Is it close to venting?
58:51:14              TELMU  No, it doesn't - it's not venting, yeah.
58:51:18             FLIGHT  Is it close to venting?
58:51:20              TELMU  It can't vent. Unless it's broken.
58:51:22             FLIGHT  Yeah.
58:51:22              TELMU  And it's not broken. Okay, what we're trying to do is relieve the pressure in
                             that tank, so we want to close the DESCENT O₂ TANK VALVE and open ASCENT O₂
                             TANK 2.
58:51:38             FLIGHT  O₂, tank 2 - how high is it?
58:51:40              TELMU  It's up to 901.
58:51:42             FLIGHT  What's it at normally?
58:51:43              TELMU  Around 830.
58:51:45             FLIGHT  And you just want to use some of that and then we'll go back -
58:51:47              TELMU  That's right.
                     FLIGHT  - to normal configuration, huh?
58:51:54             FLIGHT  Okay. Got that, Jack?
58:51:59             CAPCOM  Okay -
58:52:00             FLIGHT  TANK 2 looks a little high, so they want to use some of it.
58:52:03             CAPCOM  Okay. I got that.
58:52:04             FLIGHT  ASCENT TANK 2 -
58:52:05             CAPCOM  Close the DESCENT O₂ and open ASCENT -
58:52:08             FLIGHT  O₂ tank number 2.
58:52:09             CAPCOM  Number 2; right.
58:52:30             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
58:52:32              TELMU  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
58:52:32             FLIGHT  Is it a good idea to close the DESCENT O₂ VALVE now?
58:52:35              TELMU  Yeah, it's okay.
58:52:41              TELMU  He had to go that way, FLIGHT.
58:52:43             FLIGHT  Yeah, I know that, but I'm worried about it coming back open.
58:52:58              TELMU  Okay, we copy.
58:53:06            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
58:53:06             FLIGHT  Go.
58:53:07            CONTROL  FAO pointed out here - we are drifting around here on this middle gimbal angle
                             - he's in MIN IMPULSE right now, and I'm assuming that's where he wants to be,
                             but if he doesn't watch it close he can get himself into gimbal lock again real
                             easy.
58:53:24            CONTROL  He's not in an automatic ATTITUDE HOLD mode right now, he's in a drifting
                             flight mode.
58:53:28             FLIGHT  Yeah. He may be looking for stars -
58:53:30            CONTROL  Okay, but it might be worth a confirmation - okay, he knows that he's in there
                             because he's hitting the ACA right now. Okay.
58:53:38             FLIGHT  Okay. How's he doing on the middle gimbal?
58:53:41            CONTROL  Okay.
58:53:42             FLIGHT  Alright. Is he away from it?
58:53:44            CONTROL  Yes.
58:53:45             FLIGHT  Okay. Well, keep your eye on it, Hal. That's good.
58:53:47            CONTROL  Okay.
58:53:48             FLIGHT  Just sing out if you think he's getting close and we'll pass it up.
58:53:50            CONTROL  Roger.
58:53:56            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
58:53:57             FLIGHT  Go.
58:53:58            CONTROL  If you get a minute, I've got one little item here.
58:54:00             FLIGHT  Okay. How many amps are we taking out there - standby.
58:54:26             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:56:03             FLIGHT  CONTROL, did you have something for me?
58:56:05            CONTROL  Yes, sir. When we pressurized the RCS here, we noticed we got some - about 5
                             psi of change in the ASCENT OX and FUEL tank pressures - an increase, okay? We
                             noticed that shortly thereafter. And what we'd like to do is to make sure
                             they've got the ASCENT FEED VALVEs actually seated in the closed position. And
                             when they get time, it'll - close two circuit breakers and cycle the switches
                             for us to the closed position to make sure they are closed.
58:56:36             FLIGHT  Would you write down the procedure?
58:56:37            CONTROL  Roger.
58:56:38             FLIGHT  Bring it over, please.
58:56:38            CONTROL  Okay.
58:56:42             FLIGHT  They're talking about display circuit breakers right now. We'll let that get
                             settled.
58:56:46             CAPCOM  They're having to go up and look up some data books, but how about
                             stowage-wise, FLIGHT? Do we have to worry about passing some gear back and
                             forth? Maybe FAO ought to think about that.
58:56:59             FLIGHT  Bob? FAO? You got people working on that?
58:57:02                FAO  Say again, FLIGHT. Working on what?
58:57:05             FLIGHT  Stowage - what might want to get passed to the LM? Or from the LM to the CSM?
58:57:10                FAO  We'll have it.
58:57:57                FAO  FLIGHT, I've got -
58:58:12             CAPCOM  FLIGHT, CAPCOM.
58:58:13             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
58:58:14             CAPCOM  Okay, I have this abort PAD, and I've got some gimbal trim angles. Pitch and
                             roll are - are these the ones that were preset, or are we going to have to
                             jimmy these around?
58:58:25             FLIGHT  The preset ones probably were from docked. But let me check. RETRO?
58:58:33             FLIGHT  RETRO?
58:58:35             FLIGHT  FLIGHT.
58:58:36              RETRO  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
58:58:38             FLIGHT  These LM DPS trims, are they different than the ones in the vehicle right now?
58:58:42              RETRO  That's affirm. This is based on -
58:58:44             FLIGHT  Docked burn?
                      RETRO  - docked burn.
58:58:46             FLIGHT  And the ones they have on board are undocked, right?
58:58:48              RETRO  That's affirm. For PDI.
58:58:49             FLIGHT  Okay.
58:58:50            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL. We've got some updates on those trims.
58:58:52             FLIGHT  Oh. Okay. Well, come on in with them.
58:58:56            CONTROL  Okay, I can give them to you right now.
58:58:58             CAPCOM  This is a coordination problem on these gimbal angles - I guess we're going to
                             have to think of a procedure to coordinate the setting of those angles.
58:59:08              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
58:59:10             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, you talking to me? I don't know what you mean -
58:59:12             CAPCOM  Affirm.
                     FLIGHT  - which gimbal angles?
58:59:14             CAPCOM  The DPS trim angles.
58:59:15             FLIGHT  Yeah.
58:59:16             CAPCOM  Okay, they can't - they can't read them out on board - set them on board. They
                             have to run them and then have us verify down on the ground. Right?
58:59:27             FLIGHT  Yeah, well we can watch them trim it. I'm not sure I know what you're asking
                             me, Jack.
58:59:31             CAPCOM  We're going to have to, say - tweak it a little more and then we're going to
                             have to, say -
58:59:36             FLIGHT  No, they can trim it automatically, then load it. And run it through the
                             program.
58:59:40             CAPCOM  But we have to verify because there's a different time that -
58:59:42             FLIGHT  Oh yeah. Yeah, we can verify the number.
58:59:44             CAPCOM  Okay.
58:59:45             FLIGHT  And we're getting some new ones, so hold up on those - GUIDANCE, you calling me?
58:59:48              GUIDO  Roger. The middle gimbal angle's getting big, FLIGHT.
58:59:51             FLIGHT  Getting close?
58:59:52              GUIDO  About 60 degrees.
58:59:53             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, have him watch his gimbal angle.
58:59:56             CAPCOM  Okay, I think I hear him doing that. What do you want him to do, just -
58:59:59             FLIGHT  Well, in case he hadn't noticed, it's getting close.
59:01:21             FLIGHT  Could I get the people in the room to be quiet?
59:01:24             FLIGHT  CAPCOM's talking.
59:01:34             FLIGHT  CAPCOM - standby, CAPCOM. Hey TELMU, he's talking.
59:01:39             CAPCOM  We have any on panel 16?
59:02:55             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
59:02:57            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
59:02:58             FLIGHT  Hope you've got somebody working on a PTC procedure.
59:03:00            CONTROL  Right. We've already got one worked out, but it's an AGS-type procedure, FLIGHT.
59:03:03             FLIGHT  That's okay.
59:03:07             FLIGHT  I say that, I'm not sure if I mean that - but okay.
59:03:13             CAPCOM  Got some angles?
59:03:15              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
59:03:16             FLIGHT  Go.
59:03:17              TELMU  The CAPCOM read up the circuit breakers to open on panel 11; I don't believe he
                             turned the page over. There's some more of them. Panel 16 also.
59:03:25             FLIGHT  Just a minute, TELMU. RETRO and CONTROL, FLIGHT. The COAS angle you have N/A,
                             are they not - are they not available?
59:03:34             FLIGHT  RETRO, FLIGHT.
59:03:36              RETRO  Go, FLIGHT.
59:03:36             FLIGHT  What does this N/A mean? For the COAS?
59:03:40              RETRO  GUIDO said it was not available.
59:03:44             FLIGHT  What do you mean, not available?
59:03:45              RETRO  Not - not applicable. He said not available.
59:03:51              RETRO  You might talk with GUIDO if you want more verification on that.
59:03:55             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE?
59:04:00             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.
59:04:01              GUIDO  Go, FLIGHT.
59:04:02             FLIGHT  Don't you want to add a COAS star to this PC+2? The CAPCOM asked why not.
59:04:14              GUIDO  FLIGHT, we'd have to know which axis that thing's mounted along right now.
59:04:17             FLIGHT  Okay. You don't have enough data to figure that out, is that right, right now?
59:04:21              GUIDO  Well, I don't know if he's got it mounted along the Z-axis or the X-axis,
                             FLIGHT.
59:04:24             FLIGHT  Okay. That's what I said. Okay.
59:04:34             FLIGHT  TELMU, write down what you want us to do, please, on the circuit breaker - I
                             didn't hear you last time.
59:04:39              TELMU  The CAPCOM only read one side of that circuit breaker opening - we gave him a
                             sheet, there's circuit breakers on panel 11 and 16 to open.
59:04:48             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:04:49              TELMU  He only read up one side.
59:04:50             FLIGHT  He only read up panel 11?
59:04:51              TELMU  Yes.
59:04:52             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:04:53              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
59:04:54             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:04:54              GUIDO  We can go ahead and compute one for along the Z-axis and if it's not mounted
                             there he can move it and mount the COAS over on the Z-axis.
59:05:01             FLIGHT  Okay. Go ahead.
59:05:02              GUIDO  Okay. We'll do that.
59:05:54             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT. You copying that?
59:05:57            CONTROL  Just caught the tail end of it.
59:05:59             FLIGHT  Do you see any venting in the LM?
59:06:03            CONTROL  Negative. We've got a lot of drops in and out of data.
59:06:08             FLIGHT  Okay. He's having some difficulty with it, so look for reasons why.
59:06:11            CONTROL  Roger.
59:06:31             FLIGHT  It's 133 hours. To the AOL, to the Atlantic.
59:06:35             FLIGHT  You might let them know we're copying the VOX, too, Jack.
59:07:33             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.
59:07:34              GUIDO  We have a load, FLIGHT, but INCO says we can't COMMAND.
59:07:38             FLIGHT  Why not? INCO?
59:07:40               INCO  We can COMMAND if we go to LOW BIT RATE.
59:07:42             FLIGHT  Let's give them the numbers, then they'll punch in.
59:07:45               INCO  Sorry?
59:07:46             FLIGHT  Let's just give them the numbers to punch in.
59:07:47              GUIDO  We'll read it up to him, FLIGHT.
59:07:49             FLIGHT  Yeah.
59:08:39            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
59:08:40             FLIGHT  Go.
59:08:41            CONTROL  Okay, I've got this list of stuff here for this ascent feed.
59:08:44             FLIGHT  Okay. Bring it over. Have somebody hand it on.
59:08:52             CAPCOM  And FLIGHT, did we come up with something with regards to his - uplinking a
                             time?
59:08:57             FLIGHT  We'll have trouble uplinking the time. We'd have to go to LOW BIT RATE - can he
                             easily punch it in the DSKY there, GUIDANCE?
59:09:03         PROCEDURES  FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.
59:09:04             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:09:05         PROCEDURES  Okay, stand by on that. We're trying an uplink mode that might give us COMMAND -
59:09:07             FLIGHT  Okay.
                 PROCEDURES  - and VOICE and HIGH BIT RATE.
59:09:09             FLIGHT  Alright.
59:09:10             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
59:09:11             CAPCOM  Go.
59:09:12             FLIGHT  For your information, the problem is that we've deviate some of the frequencies
                             because of the proximity of the IU frequency, and that thing's still alive.
                             Copy?
59:09:21             CAPCOM  Okay.
59:09:22             FLIGHT  And that's - so it's a little bit nonstandard in that regard.
59:09:26             CAPCOM  Okay.
59:09:26             FLIGHT  But they're seeing what they can do. Why don't you give them a GET hack,
                             though, eh? And let them know we're reading that VOX.
59:09:41         PROCEDURES  FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.
59:09:42             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:09:42         PROCEDURES  Roger. We're on a COMMAND UPLINK mode along with VOICE, and we've got HIGH BIT
                             RATE data.
59:09:46             FLIGHT  Okay. P00 and DATA and we can give him a time - wait a minute. GUIDANCE, you
                             ready to give them a time?
59:09:50              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT. We've got the LOAD.
59:09:52             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:09:55             FLIGHT  We're ready to go, Jack.
59:10:00               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
59:10:01             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:10:02               INCO  He's got his UPDATA LINK OFF.
59:10:16             FLIGHT  CAPCOM.
59:10:25              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE. We've got the LOAD to go ahead and do it now.
59:10:27               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
59:10:28             FLIGHT  Yeah, I know. We've got another problem. Go ahead, INCO.
59:10:30               INCO  I think it would be better if we go to FORWARD OMNI on the LM now. This uplink.
59:10:43             FLIGHT  You want FORWARD OMNI?
59:10:44               INCO  Roger.
59:10:49             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
59:10:52               INCO  Hurry.
59:10:55             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, you need to - going to need to get FORWARD OMNI in the LM.
59:11:00               INCO  I believe he's already done it, FLIGHT.
59:11:02             FLIGHT  Okay. Oh, it's already done. Hm. Okay.
59:11:05             CAPCOM  Okay, and he's going to write a mission time into the LGC.
59:11:15             FLIGHT  Can you do this when you don't have a DSKY? Time?
59:11:28             FLIGHT  That'll give him his clock, will it, RETRO?
59:11:32              RETRO  That's affirmative.
59:11:32             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:11:33            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
59:11:34             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:11:35            CONTROL  Okay, if he wants to turn his inverters off, we can monitor his middle gimbal
                             angle here for him. One other suggestion I have is that he -
59:11:41             FLIGHT  Wait, wait a minute. Let me - let me hear the COMM, here.
59:12:44              RETRO  FLIGHT, RETRO. We've got a good clock update.
59:12:47             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:12:54               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
59:12:55             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:12:56               INCO  When we get a chance here, we'd like to take and change our offset on the two
                             vehicles, on how we're getting telemetry, to try to solve this tracking
                             problem. To do that we're going to have to drop the LM uplink and break lock
                             for maybe 5 to 10, 20 seconds, there.
59:13:10             FLIGHT  Okay. Well, let's just standby on that a minute.
59:13:11               INCO  Okay.
59:13:16             FLIGHT  Okay. Now, before we get into that one -
59:13:26              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
59:13:27             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:13:28              GUIDO  We'd like to have a VERB 74 some time when they can skip the DSKY.
59:13:31             FLIGHT  Okay, GUIDANCE. CAPCOM, we're ready for an E-MEMORY dump. They'll give us a
                             VERB 74, that's what you're talking about, isn't it, GUIDANCE?
59:13:38              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT.
59:13:39             FLIGHT  We're getting an E-MEMORY dump.
59:13:49             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT. You saw an increase in the ascent tanks, is that right?
                             Pressure?
59:13:53            CONTROL  Yes.
59:13:54             FLIGHT  And you want to be sure, what, that the ascent feeds are closed -
59:13:56            CONTROL  Yeah. Close those breakers and cycle those valves closed. Do not cycle to the
                             open position, just to the close position.
59:14:03  CAPCOM (off loop)  - when he pressurized the -
59:14:04             FLIGHT  Yeah, RCS. And we want to do an E-MEMORY dump whenever they can get around to
                             it, we're all ready to receive it.
59:14:11            CONTROL  Okay, I've got one item, FLIGHT.
59:14:13             FLIGHT  Say again?
59:14:14            CONTROL  This is CONTROL. We want to power down his inverters -
59:14:19             CAPCOM  Coming at you.
                    CONTROL  - and in order to do that, we're going to have to look at his middle gimbal
                             angle for him on the ground. And to make it easier, he needs to get out of this
                             MIN IMPULSE mode. He needs to go to - PGNS MODE CONTROL to AUTO when he gets to
                             an attitude that he likes.
59:14:34             FLIGHT  That's - yeah. Okay.
59:14:37             FLIGHT  But now, wait a minute. Before we do any of that, I want to hear what it is
                             control configuration we're going to be in, and whether we can keep the PGNS up
                             or whether we're going to bring the AGS up, etc.
59:14:49            CONTROL  Okay.
59:14:50             FLIGHT  I want to get the holes dug before we start doing more things.
59:14:52            CONTROL  Roger.
59:14:55             FLIGHT  Let me see if - have you heard that one of the suggestions is to align the AGS
                             to the PGNS, power the PGNS down, use the AGS, and then bring the PGNS back up
                             and do a P52 for the burn?
59:15:08            CONTROL  That's right, FLIGHT.
59:15:09             FLIGHT  Okay. Well, I'd like to get that whole complex of control modes and what we're
                             going to do in currents sorted out before we start changing things.
59:15:16            CONTROL  Okay.
59:15:17             FLIGHT  Or we'll be doing this all night. Okay, Hal?
59:15:20            CONTROL  Roger.
59:15:21             FLIGHT  And I'm open to any suggestions here as to what the reasonable course of action
                             - the last I heard from -
59:15:28             FLIGHT  - staff is that they're going to try to run that again in the simulator, I
                             believe.
59:15:33            CONTROL  Okay.
59:16:20         PROCEDURES  FLIGHT, PROCEDURES.
59:16:22             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:16:22         PROCEDURES  Roger, we're going to have to write a RESTART. 10 second loss of data.
59:16:26             FLIGHT  Okay, everybody. Stand by for 10 second loss of data.
59:17:03             FLIGHT  - yeah. CONTROL, FLIGHT.
59:17:06             FLIGHT  Hal? CONTROL, FLIGHT.
59:17:10            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
59:17:11             FLIGHT  Hal, Tom Stafford's coming over. Would you chat with him about this thing?
59:17:15            CONTROL  On the - PGNS/AGS?
59:17:17             FLIGHT  Yeah.
59:17:17            CONTROL  Roger.
59:17:18              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
59:17:19             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:17:19              GUIDO  We got a good E-MOD, FLIGHT.
59:17:21             FLIGHT  Okay, CAPCOM. We got a good E-MOD. Do they need to terminate anything,
                             GUIDANCE, or does it terminate? Oh, it terminates.
59:17:27              GUIDO  No, it's okay.
59:17:28             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:18:15             FLIGHT  And that's the Atlantic, too, Jack, for their info. That's the Atlantic.
59:18:34             FLIGHT  Yeah - we haven't made our mind we want to go there, but that's the PAD -
                             that's the abort data he has in board.
59:18:45             FLIGHT  It's the minimum return.
59:18:50             FLIGHT  Yeah.
59:18:56              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
59:18:57             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:18:58              GUIDO  We'd like to send him a REFSMMAT sometime, FLIGHT. If he gives P00 and ACCEPT.
59:19:03             FLIGHT  What kind of REFSMMAT?
59:19:04              GUIDO  It's the one that they're aligned to. They were carrying one pre - prelaunch,
                             and it's not the one that they're aligned to right now. We're going to give
                             them the right matrix.
59:19:16             FLIGHT  Okay, and then what does he do? Align to it?
59:19:18              GUIDO  No, no. He's fine. We just need to get it in there.
59:19:21             FLIGHT  Oh, so he has it on board?
59:19:23              GUIDO  Right.
59:19:26             FLIGHT  Okay. Okay, CAPCOM - are you ready to do that now?
59:19:28              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT.
59:19:29             FLIGHT  Do you want to send them a state vector, too, by the way?
59:19:31              GUIDO  Negative, FLIGHT. We want to hold off on that.
59:19:32             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:19:33              GUIDO  I'm not sure what the LM will do with it. We're having MIT run the hybrid, and
                             see what it would do with this kind of -
59:19:38             FLIGHT  Oh, that's right, because it doesn't navigate out here.
59:19:40              GUIDO  That's right. So, we're having them run it on the hybrid, and check it out -
59:19:42             FLIGHT  The REFSMMAT - I'm not - GUIDANCE, say one more time why you want them to have
                             a REFSMMAT, because he doesn't have one -
59:19:48              GUIDO  He doesn't have the one he's aligned to right now, FLIGHT -
59:19:50             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      GUIDO  - he aligned to the PTC and he was carrying another one.
59:19:53             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:19:56             FLIGHT  Yeah. We want him to have the one he's aligned to.
59:19:58              GUIDO  And we're also going to stick a TFN in, FLIGHT.
59:20:03             CAPCOM  Alright, you want P00 and DATA now? You ready to go?
59:20:05              GUIDO  That's affirm. We're ready.
59:20:33             FLIGHT  Go ahead, GUIDANCE.
59:20:34              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT. We're picking up.
59:20:53               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
59:20:54             FLIGHT  Go.
59:20:54               INCO  Can we try that procedure now?
59:20:58             FLIGHT  Just a minute, Ed. Let me see what else is cooking, I don't have any -
59:21:01              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
                     FLIGHT  - reason why not to. Go ahead, GUIDANCE.
59:21:03              GUIDO  We don't have the DUA. He gave us P00, but he didn't give us the DUA.
59:21:10             FLIGHT  Okay, we need the DATA position, right?
59:21:12               INCO  Roger.
59:21:12              GUIDO  Roger.
59:21:13             FLIGHT  CAPCOM. CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
59:21:16             CAPCOM  Go, FLIGHT.
59:21:17             FLIGHT  We got Program 00 but he needs to go to DATA first to get the load in.
59:21:29             FLIGHT  Okay. We're loading the REFSMMAT -
59:21:39               INCO  That's probably what it is, FLIGHT.
59:21:40             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:21:42  FLIGHT (off loop)  Yeah, they'll have to.
59:21:51               INCO  We've got it, FLIGHT.
59:21:52             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:21:53              GUIDO  We're picking up, FLIGHT.
59:21:57             FLIGHT  Okay. We're loading the REFSMMAT. We've got the VERB 74. CONTROL, FLIGHT, did
                             you see him cycle the valves on the ascent feed?
59:22:05            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
59:22:06             FLIGHT  Did he cycle the valves on the ascent feed? Jack says he did it.
59:22:09            CONTROL  Okay, we can't see that he did it, FLIGHT, on TM.
59:22:12             FLIGHT  Okay, but he did do it.
59:22:13            CONTROL  Okay, FLIGHT, thank you.
59:22:14             FLIGHT  Okay. He cycled the ascent feeds - -
59:22:22             FLIGHT  Okay, now, we're working on what we're going to do with the configuration. We
                             need to get some kind of PTC going for us here, and we need to decide what we
                             want to do with our control configuration - you're working all that, huh,
                             CONTROL?
59:22:33            CONTROL  Trying my best to, FLIGHT.
59:22:34             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:22:36               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. We're coming up on AFT OMNI for the LM.
59:22:39             FLIGHT  Do you want us to switch now?
59:22:40               INCO  Right.
59:22:41             FLIGHT  We're right in the middle of a load.
59:22:42               INCO  Okay, we'll - hold as long as we can.
59:22:48               INCO  He got it pretty quick on there anyway.
59:27:40              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
59:27:41             FLIGHT  Go.
59:27:41              GUIDO  We're through COMMANDing to the LM.
59:27:43             FLIGHT  Through COMMANDing, CAPCOM.
59:27:47              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
59:27:48             FLIGHT  Go.
59:27:49              TELMU  I'd like to go ahead and get that DUA off the line.
59:27:51             FLIGHT  Okay. We're through COMMANDing, CAPCOM, and they can take that circuit breaker
                             - the DUA circuit breaker out again.
59:27:56              TELMU  And FLIGHT, TELMU.
59:27:57             FLIGHT  Go.
59:27:59              TELMU  We'd like to get as much gear off here as we can. We'd like for you to think
                             about turning this inverter off.
59:28:06             FLIGHT  Again, here? Which inverter?
59:28:08              TELMU  The LM inverter. Inverter 2.
59:28:10             FLIGHT  It's running the eight-ball. Yeah, I need to tie that together with how we're
                             going to fly this thing, Merlin - I'm waiting to get this whole thing.
59:28:18              TELMU  Understand, but -
59:28:19             FLIGHT  I understand what you're saying.
59:28:20              TELMU  Okay.
59:28:21             FLIGHT  How many amps are we taking with that?
59:28:23              TELMU  Well, we're pulling about 2 amps.
59:28:26             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:28:26              TELMU  It'll run a little bit ??.
59:28:27             FLIGHT  Well, I know. I agree with you.
59:28:30              TELMU  Let me get -
59:28:31             FLIGHT  Let me - ah, okay.
59:28:33              TELMU  The water rate right now, we're pulling about 7 pounds per hour. And at current
                             capabilities, about 34 hours. Descent water.
59:28:43             FLIGHT  Say again?
59:28:44              TELMU  About 34 hours on the descent water at the present rate.
59:28:53             FLIGHT  Oh, okay. Okay, but we should be able to take the PGNS and and the IMU off -
59:28:56              TELMU  That's right.
                     FLIGHT  - at some point.
59:29:11             FLIGHT  Okay. I'd like to get everybody up here a minute. RETRO, GUIDANCE, CONTROL,
                             TELMU, GNC and EECOM, and CAPCOM. INCO and FAO. Is everybody on the loop, give
                             me an amber, please.
59:29:27             FLIGHT  RETRO, you up?
59:29:30             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, get RETRO up in the loop, will you please?
59:29:32              RETRO  Go ahead.
59:29:33             FLIGHT  Look. As I see it, we've got a number of things to do. No big hurry right now.
                             We've gotta maintain COMM here, of course, with the LM. But we need to see what
                             we need to do about setting up a PTC attitude and an arrange - a control mode.
                             And what that means relative to the AGS and the PGNS configuration as to
                             powering the AGS down, etc. Now, CONTROL, you're working that problem, right?
59:29:59            CONTROL  Roger.
59:30:04             FLIGHT  And I'm proceeding now just staying put until we get that whole story put
                             together - and how long is it going to take you, do you think, to come to some
                             conclusion on that, Hal?
59:30:13            CONTROL  I don't have an estimate right now, FLIGHT. We're trying to get it to you as
                             soon as -
59:30:16             FLIGHT  About an hour?
59:30:17            CONTROL  Yeah.
59:30:18             FLIGHT  Alright. Now, so - so we'll just standby on that. We are interested, though, in
                             this also from the point of view of the power configuration. TELMU, I assume
                             you're working out all the consumable options, and as soon as CONTROL's got a
                             mode here you're going to be able to lay out a power profile to tell us where
                             we stand on all your O₂, and your water, and your power, right?
59:30:42              TELMU  Wilco.
59:30:43             FLIGHT  But can you say something generally, now? Generally, we can come all the way
                             home at 25 amps, right? On the LM?
59:30:51              TELMU  Not with this water usage right now, FLIGHT.
59:30:54             FLIGHT  No, but if we go down to 25 amps all of that will help us, won't it?
59:31:00             FLIGHT  Oh, I see what you're saying. 25 amps - not much.
59:31:02              TELMU  Yeah, that's not going to help us that much, FLIGHT.
59:31:05             FLIGHT  Okay. Well, what do we have to get down to? For example?
59:31:11              TELMU  Standby - I would think about 15 amps or so.
59:31:13             FLIGHT  From the point of view of the water now we've got to get down there -
59:31:15              TELMU  Yeah. About 15, I think.
59:31:18             FLIGHT  Can we do that? In a life support/COMM mode?
59:31:21              TELMU  Say again, FLIGHT?
59:31:22             FLIGHT  We could be at 15 amps in a life support/COMM mode, could we not?
59:31:25              TELMU  That's affirmative.
59:31:27             FLIGHT  Alright. Now, we need to figure out something also for your CO₂ scrubbing,
                             right?
59:31:31              TELMU  Right.
59:31:31             FLIGHT  And - and EECOM needs to - naw, he's going to do that over in his vehicle if we
                             have to get into that. I've got a note up here that I don't quite understand,
                             it says LM LiOH is 48 man-hours. That doesn't sound quite right to me.
59:31:46              TELMU  That's on the cartridge - standby, we'll get you consumables.
59:31:51             FLIGHT  Alright. But TELMU, I'd like some people to start running consumable profiles
                             out, making a couple of different assumptions and not standing by, waiting for
                             everything - and please have somebody run it out grossly, you know, so that we
                             continue to have at least a story even though it's not the most accurate one;
                             you can continue to refine it as you go along.
59:32:10              TELMU  Roger.
59:32:11             FLIGHT  I'd like to relatively soon here get some idea how we stand and what we're -
                             boxes we're running into and when we've got to start deciding things, okay?
59:32:19              TELMU  Wilco.
59:32:20             FLIGHT  Okay, does anybody have anything else besides those areas that they want to
                             bring to our attention right now?
59:32:28               INCO  INC - FLIGHT, INCO.
59:32:29             FLIGHT  Yes. INCO.
59:32:30               INCO  If we can get that change done, we can get some tracking data for FDO, we'd
                             hope. If you'll let us drop the uplink and the downlink from the LM for about
                             25 seconds.
59:32:38             FLIGHT  And then re-establish it?
59:32:41               INCO  Right.
59:32:42             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:32:43               INCO  We'd like you to alert the crew that they're not going to have contact for a
                             few seconds.
59:32:46             FLIGHT  Okay. Let me go around, Ed, and then we'll pick that up. Does anybody have
                             anything else? Let me go around the room. Trench - RETRO? FDO? GUIDANCE?
59:32:55              GUIDO  Negative, FLIGHT.
59:32:56             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, you okay? Well, go back green then, please. CONTROL, you got anything
                             else?
59:33:00            CONTROL  Negative, FLIGHT.
59:33:01             FLIGHT  Okay. TELMU?
59:33:03              TELMU  Negative, FLIGHT.
59:33:04             FLIGHT  Okay. I want to start hearing from you, TELMU, on these consumables.
59:33:07              TELMU  Say again, FLIGHT?
59:33:07             FLIGHT  I want to start hearing from you as you get some -
59:33:09              TELMU  Roger. We're cranking.
59:33:11             FLIGHT  Okay, go back green, then. GNC?
59:33:13                GNC  Negative, FLIGHT.
59:33:14             FLIGHT  EECOM?
59:33:14              EECOM  Negative.
59:33:16             FLIGHT  Green, please. CAPCOM, Jack, can you think of anything we ought to be working
                             on other than those mentioned?
59:33:21             CAPCOM  I didn't get all you mentioned, but are we working on bringing the AGS up?
59:33:25             FLIGHT  Yeah, that's a possibility, you know? As to whether we gotta do that for the
                             PTC, and do what Tom suggested here.
59:33:34             CAPCOM  Well, we could bring it up and have it there, and it'd be a good idea to make
                             sure it's working.
59:33:38             FLIGHT  Yeah. I just don't want to use any more power right now, or any more water.
59:33:43             CAPCOM  Okay.
59:33:45             FLIGHT  As soon as we know a little more about what we really ought to do, then we'll
                             proceed to spend the consumables to do that. Anything else that you can think
                             of?
59:33:54             CAPCOM  I'd like to have a little more information upon the crew's trajectory with
                             relation to the Moon that we could pass up.
59:34:00             FLIGHT  Yes, and INCO is gonna - at the end of this go-around the room, we're going to
                             ask the crew to standby for about 25 seconds of COMM loss while we do some
                             reconfiguring in an attempt to get tracking on the LM. Okay? But we still think
                             they're close - FDO, FLIGHT? What -
59:34:19                FDO  Go, FLIGHT.
59:34:19             FLIGHT  What closest approach are you estimating right now on the LM?
59:34:23                FDO  Still looking at about 60 miles, FLIGHT.
59:34:25             FLIGHT  You're still looking at 60, Jack.
59:34:27             CAPCOM  60 miles.
59:34:28             FLIGHT  Yeah.
59:34:28             CAPCOM  And -
59:34:29             FLIGHT  And this COMM thing we're going through is to try to re-establish tracking on
                             the LM; right now, we don't have tracking.
59:34:36             CAPCOM  Okay, thank you.
59:34:37             FLIGHT  You can go back green, then, if you will. Okay - SURGEON, you have anything?
59:34:41            SURGEON  Yeah, two things. We're figuring, looking at this CO₂ problem with you - at
                             what point in time we'd arrive at various levels of CO₂ in the LM
                             configuration. The other thing is, when we - at some point in time we'd like to
                             get that BIOMED switch on in the LM - it's in the OFF position.
59:35:02             FLIGHT  Okay. Okay, you want to go back green, then? INCO, anything besides that COMM -
59:35:13             FLIGHT  INCO, anything else? Go back green, then. AFD?
59:35:16                AFD  Negative, FLIGHT.
59:35:18             FLIGHT  FAO, you have anything you're working on - that's stowage, right?
59:35:21                FAO  That's affirmative, FLIGHT.
59:35:21             FLIGHT  Any suggestions we might have as to what they might move to the LM, or move to
                             the CSM.
59:35:26                FAO  That's right. We're working on that. I think it'll be minimal anyway.
59:35:29             FLIGHT  Okay. And NETWORK, you got anything?
59:35:32            NETWORK  Well, we hope to have Honeysuckle 210 up by 62 hours for voice only.
59:35:38             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:35:38            NETWORK  We hope to have them up by then.
59:35:40             FLIGHT  Okay. RECOVERY? You got anything?
59:35:43           RECOVERY  Negative, FLIGHT. Present efforts are to identify ships on the Atlantic and the
                             Indian Ocean.
59:35:48             FLIGHT  Okay. NETWORK, you want to go back green, then? Okay, there are the subjects,
                             and we need to start getting some - closed out on some of them here, gentlemen.
                             So. Let us bend our efforts to get that done.
59:36:05               INCO  Got a GO, FLIGHT?
59:36:07             FLIGHT  Yeah. CAPCOM, would you call the crew and tell them we're going to drop COMM
                             for half a minute here while we try to establish tracking?
59:36:14             CAPCOM  Okay.
59:36:15             FLIGHT  And let them know that our best estimate of the EC's got a 60 mile perigee
                             right now.
59:36:20               INCO  And FLIGHT, if you'll confirm AFT OMNI.
59:36:23             FLIGHT  And you want AFT OMNI?
59:36:24               INCO  Affirm.
59:36:24             FLIGHT  Okay. Got that, CAPCOM?
59:37:01             FLIGHT  Okay, INCO. We've told them. Go ahead.
59:37:03               INCO  Thank you, FLIGHT.
59:39:51             (note)  << An off-loop conversation is partially caught here, which appears to pertain
                             to powering some elements of the CSM off the LM, possibly to use its life
                             support system. Additional conversation discusses a burn - possibly the one
                             that occurs in the final chapter of this audio to bring the crew back onto a
                             free-return trajectory to Earth as soon as possible, rather than waiting until
                             PC+2 at 79 hours. >>
59:41:38             FLIGHT  EECOM, you copy that?
59:41:41              EECOM  That sounds okay here, FLIGHT.
59:41:42             FLIGHT  Okay with us, Jack.
59:41:49              EECOM  We agree with all of that.
59:41:57             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
59:41:58             CAPCOM  Go, FLIGHT.
59:41:59             FLIGHT  As a matter of fact, Jack, why don't you let them know that we're currently -
                             since it's so quiet from here - trying to figure out what's the best
                             configuration to do here relative to maintaining control, maintaining some kind
                             of PTC, staying in the posture that we can do the burn properly, and playing
                             that against the consumables. And as soon as we get a reasonably coherent story
                             we'll brief them in full on it. Okay?
59:42:26             CAPCOM  Okay. How about - are we getting a flight plan worked out, modified, so forth?
59:42:33                FAO  We are working on that, FLIGHT.
59:42:34             FLIGHT  Yeah, working on it. And you might also tell them that we've got Gene Cernan
                             and the guys over in the simulator checking stars, etc, in this configuration.
59:42:44             CAPCOM  Okay.
59:42:45             FLIGHT  And anything that they would like us to run, we can proceed to do it.
59:43:03              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
59:43:05             FLIGHT  TELMU, let me hear the COMM. Okay? Can we hear it? Do you need something?
59:43:10              TELMU  We've got to power down, here, pretty quick.
59:43:12             FLIGHT  Okay. TELMU, go.
59:43:16              TELMU  We ought to - recommend turning the power off - POWER AMPL off, going to LOW
                             BIT RATE, and getting his AC off, and probably bringing the AGS up on standby.
59:43:32             FLIGHT  Okay. What consumable are you running into trouble with, TELMU?
59:43:35              TELMU  Water and electric power.
59:43:39             FLIGHT  Okay. Can you relate some facts to me, here?
59:43:44              TELMU  Like I said, the water is - present rate, we've only got 34 hours left.
59:43:57             FLIGHT  Go ahead. Power?
59:44:00              TELMU  Standby 1.
59:44:19              TELMU  Okay, the power is 67.5 hours, FLIGHT.
59:44:23             FLIGHT  Is that ascent and descent?
59:44:25              TELMU  That's affirm.
59:44:26             FLIGHT  At the present load, is that right?.
59:44:28              TELMU  That's right.
59:44:32              TELMU  That's what I - I think we just need to get some things powered down ASAP.
59:44:37             FLIGHT  Okay. Now what are you suggesting, again?
59:44:39              TELMU  I'm suggesting POWER AMPL -
59:44:41             FLIGHT  POWER AMPL. How much does that save?
                      TELMU  - and LOW BIT RATE - that's about 2.5 amps.
59:44:45             FLIGHT  Alright.
59:44:49              TELMU  And the AC, which is about 2 amps.
59:44:51             FLIGHT  Well, that loses his ball; then we don't have anything. Right? I mean, we don't
                             have the data on the ground - do you have IMU data on the LOW BIT RATE there,
                             CONTROL?
59:45:01            CONTROL  All we'd have is resolvers. It's good enough.
59:45:03             FLIGHT  You can watch it?
59:45:04            CONTROL  Yeah, we can watch the gimbal angle.
59:45:06             FLIGHT  What control mode is he in now?
59:45:07            CONTROL  He's in PGNS MIN IMPULSE.
59:45:09             FLIGHT  So he's still flying it around.
59:45:10            CONTROL  Yes.
59:45:15             FLIGHT  I think it's kind of difficult to talk them through, isn't it?
59:45:23             FLIGHT  He'd have to bring the ball up to fly it, I'd think.
59:45:25              TELMU  Well, my thought if we go there, FLIGHT, was if he goes to an ATTITUDE HOLD
                             mode now, and out of this drifting flight mode, he'll hold the attitude he's in
                             now.
59:45:31            CONTROL  Okay, then you don't have to worry about it.
59:45:33             FLIGHT  Was that what you want to start - recommend, and EECO - TELMU's getting in a
                             hurry, here.
59:45:38            CONTROL  Yeah, well, I don't blame him.
59:45:39             CAPCOM  What's going on with the COMMs, FLIGHT?
59:45:41             FLIGHT  I don't know.
59:45:49             FLIGHT  What else, TELMU, have you got anything else to suggest?
59:45:53              TELMU  Negative, FLIGHT.
59:45:55             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
59:45:56            CONTROL  Go ahead.
59:45:57             FLIGHT  Now, how about you? What can you do to help? What do we need to do to decide
                             whether to go to the AGS or not, here?
59:46:05            CONTROL  Well -
59:46:06             FLIGHT  Do we know whether or not the - results of this star business in the simulator
                             worked?
59:46:10            CONTROL  That was a request I've got in to SPAN, FLIGHT, to measure drift rates on this
                             particular platform to see what it would look like when we got out to 79.5
                             hours.
59:46:22             FLIGHT  Okay. But if we can see stars, we can do a P52.
59:46:24            CONTROL  Yes, if he can see the stars, then that kind of falls out, you know? And if
                             that - if he can do a 52 align we'd definitely recommend to transfer the
                             alignment into the AGS and turn the AGS on, turn the PGNS down.
59:46:36             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
59:46:37             CAPCOM  Go.
59:46:38             FLIGHT  What are you getting out of the star sighting discussions?
59:46:41             CAPCOM  Well, the last thing I heard was that the sunlight reflected off the thrusters
                             - made it so as they couldn't see the stars and they also had a lot of debris
                             still floating around with them, so they are unable to -
59:46:52             FLIGHT  Couldn't see them out of what? Out of the window? Or out of the AOT?
59:46:56             CAPCOM  Out of the window.
59:46:57             FLIGHT  Have they tried the AOT yet, do you know? The reason I'm asking is that we're
                             running low on water. I mean, we're going to run out of water in 34 hours at
                             the current power level.
59:47:36             FLIGHT  How about going to LOW BIT RATE? The POWER AMPL OFF and the LOW BIT RATE?
                             CONTROL? Can you do that now?
59:47:41            CONTROL  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
59:47:41             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, can you do that now?
59:47:43              GUIDO  Roger, FLIGHT.
59:47:45             FLIGHT  INCO, okay with you?
59:47:48             FLIGHT  INCO?
59:47:48               INCO  Say again, FLIGHT?
59:47:49             FLIGHT  Okay with you if we turn the POWER AMPL OFF and go to LOW BIT RATE?
59:47:53               INCO  Well, why don't you let us get ourselves swung in, here, and see how we're
                             going to work out with this problem? We're -
59:47:58             FLIGHT  What just happened?
                       INCO  - in the midst of that procedure, there.
59:47:59             FLIGHT  Oh, okay. You're still in the middle of that.
59:48:00               INCO  Right.
59:48:01             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:48:02             CAPCOM  I don't have any COMM with them, FLIGHT.
59:48:07             FLIGHT  INCO, FLIGHT. Do we have no uplink right now?
59:48:11             FLIGHT  How come? We still - I thought that was only going to take 30 seconds.
59:48:43               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. I don't think he's got an uplink COMM mode right now.
59:48:46             FLIGHT  Well, can we get one?
59:48:47               INCO  Yeah, he's coming through right in that spot that I told you about, there.
                             We're trying to force that lock now, and as soon as we get it we'll give you a
                             call.
59:48:53             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:48:54             CAPCOM  Are we tracking them yet, FLIGHT?
59:48:56               INCO  For reference, going to POWER AMPL OFF on an OMNI in LOW BIT RATE -
59:49:00             FLIGHT  Wait a minute, wait a minute, Ed. The CAPCOM wants to know when we're going to
                             have COMM. Is it coming back shortly?
59:49:06               INCO  I'll give you a call. It'll be back shortly.
59:49:08             FLIGHT  Alright. Okay, now the POWER AMPL.
59:49:09               INCO  If we turn the POWER AMPL OFF, go to LOW BIT RATE and stay on an OMNI, if we go
                             to DOWN VOICE BACKUP; we may be able to make it. It'll be very close.
59:49:18             FLIGHT  Make what?
59:49:19               INCO  Voice.
59:49:22             FLIGHT  Up or down?
59:49:23               INCO  Both.
59:49:26               INCO  It's going to be marginal.
59:49:33               INCO  I'd like to give it a try, though.
59:49:35             FLIGHT  Okay, well let's finish up your test. Are you finished with that test?
59:49:38               INCO  No, they're not quite finished yet. Standby.
59:50:14             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
59:50:16              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
59:50:17             FLIGHT  Merlin, I've got your problem, and I appreciate your concern. Right now we're
                             trying to get the COMM back - we kind of have to get his assessment of this
                             thing to see whether we can bring the PGNS down now.
59:50:28              TELMU  Okay. What about the AC? Did - you still kicking that around?
59:50:32             FLIGHT  Well, that's a problem. I don't know what we're going to do for PTC yet. I'm
                             waiting for CONTROL. Without the - we can't just sit there in ATTITUDE HOLD.
                             And I don't know about setting up a PTC in the LM.
59:50:46              TELMU  Okay.
59:50:57             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
59:50:58            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
59:50:58             FLIGHT  Are his attitudes moving around some? Or is he essentially fixed?
59:51:03            CONTROL  Essentially static in attitude.
59:51:07            CONTROL  He's moving just a little bit but not a heck of a lot.
59:51:41              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
59:51:42             FLIGHT  Sup - go ahead.
59:51:43              TELMU  This ASCENT TANK 2 pressure has gone back down to a nominal value. We'd like to
                             go back to the DESCENT O₂.
59:51:50             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:51:51              TELMU  Close TANK 2 and open DESCENT TANK.
59:51:53             FLIGHT  Okay. CAP - INCO, are we anywhere near back in COMM yet?
59:51:58               INCO  FLIGHT, if you just hang on a couple of more seconds here, maybe we can get
                             this thing squared away so we get the tracking data that FDO needs. That's what
                             we're after, here.
59:52:06             FLIGHT  I understand that.
59:52:07               INCO  No, we're not - we don't have a good COMM mode at this time.
59:52:10             FLIGHT  Alright.
59:52:12             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, when you get COMM back, we can go back to DESCENT O₂. You got that,
                             Jack?
59:52:37  FLIGHT (off loop)  Is it the same procedure?
59:52:56             FLIGHT  GNC and CONTROL, FLIGHT.
59:52:59            CONTROL  CONTROL here.
59:53:00             FLIGHT  Is somebody working me out a PTC procedure?
59:53:03            CONTROL  Yeah, we're trying to get one before they go. We've got one for the AGS right
                             now, FLIGHT.
59:53:06             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:53:29               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
59:53:30             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:53:30               INCO  It looks like we're getting it slowly, here. We're just about there. As soon as
                             you get it, we'd like to go to FORWARD OMNI.
59:53:37             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:54:14             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
59:54:16              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
59:54:17             FLIGHT  Merlin, how many amps are we using with the LGC and the IMU?
59:54:20              TELMU  Just about 12 amps.
59:54:21             FLIGHT  Total?
59:54:22              TELMU  Yeah.
59:54:28              TELMU  It's 10 amps, FLIGHT.
59:54:29             FLIGHT  Total. So we still have about 20 amps, huh?
59:54:32              TELMU  Yeah.
59:54:35             FLIGHT  But they're the - they would be the big coolant items, wouldn't they? 
59:54:38              TELMU  Yeah -
59:54:38             FLIGHT  That ought to improve the coolant picture a heck of a lot more than 30 percent.
59:54:41              TELMU  Yup.
59:55:40             FLIGHT  INCO, can we talk yet?
59:55:45            NETWORK  That's a negative, FLIGHT. There's no uplink.
59:55:49             FLIGHT  INCO, have I got an estimate?
59:55:52               INCO  FLIGHT, let me tell you what's happened. While we were trying to lock it up,
                             we've drifted around into FORWARD OMNI country. So right now we're in FORWARD
                             OMNI, we've got AFT selected, and he doesn't know because -
59:56:01             FLIGHT  How so?
                       INCO  - he has his display breaker pulled. So if I can bear on your indulgence to
                             wait until we swing all the way around to the AFT OMNI, then we can get this -
59:56:09             FLIGHT  We're not exactly swinging, you know?
59:56:10               INCO  Yes, we are, FLIGHT.
59:56:11             FLIGHT  Are we? We moving around?
59:56:12               INCO  We sure are.
59:56:14             FLIGHT  Like this? As far as you can -
59:56:15               INCO  No, like this.
59:56:19             FLIGHT  Pitch? Kind of?
59:56:21               INCO  Roll. LM Yaw.
59:56:26             FLIGHT  Command Module roll.
59:56:27               INCO  Look at channel 32.
59:56:34             FLIGHT  Yeah, okay, well - I don't know how to read that one. Is that roll?
59:56:40            CONTROL  FLIGHT, we are pitching right now.
59:56:42             FLIGHT  Pitching, you said.
59:56:43            CONTROL  Roger.
59:56:43             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:56:44            CONTROL  60 degrees, now.
59:56:45              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
59:56:46             FLIGHT  Well, wait a minute. You guys have data? We should - should we be able to get
                             through then, on the COMM?
59:56:49              TELMU  Roger.
59:56:50             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, you should - INCO, do you think we've got COMM now?
59:56:54               INCO  Give it a try, and get him to say FORWARD OMNI if he shows anything.
59:56:57             FLIGHT  Okay, CAPCOM.
59:57:01              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
59:57:02             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
59:57:03              TELMU  I'll come up a minute.
59:57:04             FLIGHT  Come ahead, Merlin.
59:57:08               INCO  Jack, say FORWARD OMNI.
59:57:39             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, as soon as you get a hold of him, would you get him to say what he
                             wants to say about the starfield? And you can tell him to go back to the
                             DESCENT O₂. CONTROL, from FLIGHT.
59:57:49            CONTROL  Go ahead.
59:57:49             FLIGHT  I'm becoming convinced that we don't have any choice here, but that we've got
                             to go to some kind of AGS mode, here.
59:57:54            CONTROL  That's right; I'm taking the procedure now.
59:57:56             FLIGHT  Okay. You getting it all written up?
59:57:58            CONTROL  I'm getting it - partly out of the Activation checklist.
59:58:00             FLIGHT  Okay.
59:58:10             FLIGHT  The - procedure - procedure is available from these - from CONTROL for the AGS
                             PTC, and I think we're running out of choices. We're probably just going to
                             have to -
59:58:20               INCO  CAPCOM, you might try it now.
59:59:03             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, have you - have you got them yet?
59:59:07             CAPCOM  No, I haven't got them yet.
59:59:09             FLIGHT  There he is. Okay, everybody. Here's COMM.
59:59:25             FLIGHT  It's probably due to our configuration.
59:59:35               INCO  FORWARD OMNI.
59:59:38             FLIGHT  And we need FORWARD OMNI.
60:00:05               INCO  Okay.
60:00:15             CAPCOM  He's been on it, and he is on FORWARD OMNI, and the COMM has a lot of
                             background noise from Houston.
60:00:20             FLIGHT  Okay. What can we do, INCO?
60:00:22               INCO  Okay, let me just try one more thing, we'll be with you.
60:00:24             FLIGHT  Alright. Hurry.
60:00:33             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
60:00:35             CAPCOM  Go, FLIGHT.
60:00:36             FLIGHT  Look. When we get them, you get the O₂ business straightened out. But tell them
                             that we have to, very soon, decide to bring the AGS up, and do things with that.
60:01:04             FLIGHT  INCO -
60:01:22             FLIGHT  INCO, FLIGHT. What are we getting?
60:01:28             FLIGHT  What are we getting?
60:01:54             FLIGHT  INCO, FLIGHT. Are we going to get COMM back? I'm going to knock off the
                             tracking here in a minute. That 30 second -
60:01:59               INCO  That's - FLIGHT, we're -
                     FLIGHT  - test has run too long.
60:02:01               INCO  Right. We're going back to the normal mode. Standby.
60:02:12             FLIGHT  CONTROL, you write -
60:02:36              TELMU  And close ASCENT.
60:02:37             FLIGHT  Yeah.
60:02:49             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, does he have anything to say about stars and P52 yet?
60:02:57             CAPCOM  No, I haven't heard any word. I can't ask him a question because he can't read
                             me.
60:03:00             FLIGHT  Yeah. INCO, have we reconfigured yet?
60:03:11               INCO  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
60:03:11             FLIGHT  We reconfigured yet?
60:03:12               INCO  Negative.
60:03:13             FLIGHT  How long?
60:03:14               INCO  No estimate. I'll get it for you soon as we can.
60:03:32               INCO  FLIGHT, we have a 2 minute estimate.
60:03:35             FLIGHT  Okay.
60:04:39               INCO  Negative, FLIGHT.
60:04:40             FLIGHT  It was us, Jack.
60:04:43             FLIGHT  It was the ground configuration.
60:05:32               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. We need AFT OMNI.
60:05:58               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. AFT OMNI.
60:05:59             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, AFT OMNI.
60:06:03                FAO  And FLIGHT, FAO.
60:06:04             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:06:04                FAO  If he wants to try the method John's been talking about, we can give them an
                             attitude to go to.
60:06:15               INCO  FLIGHT, that's the IU frequency. Just say AFT OMNI and we'll be in there, I
                             think.
60:06:31             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT. How are you doing?
60:06:33            CONTROL  We're just about there, FLIGHT, on this AGS turn-on procedure.
60:06:37             FLIGHT  Okay. Okay.
60:06:38              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
60:06:39             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:06:40              TELMU  Can we go ahead and get the POWER AMPL off?
60:06:44             FLIGHT  I'm afraid to do anything to the COMM right now, until we have this discussion
                             with them about what we want them to do, Merlin.
60:06:56             FLIGHT  - I sure do. And I want to get it off as bad as you do.
60:07:00              TELMU  Right.
60:07:20             FLIGHT  Can - TELMU, FLIGHT.
60:07:24             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
60:07:25             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
60:07:28             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
60:07:35             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
60:07:36              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
60:07:37             FLIGHT  Is there much of a difference to you to operate on the AGS, with the PGNS down?
                             Water-wise?
60:07:42             CAPCOM  Are they still on FORWARD OMNI?
60:07:42              TELMU  Well, it's about - about 3 amps, but primarily the AGS does run a little
                             cooler, and you'd be bringing up a new piece of gear. So, it'd be a different
                             thermal load, there.
60:07:54             FLIGHT  Yeah. Well, I want to get into this configuration and try it.
60:07:56              TELMU  Yeah.
60:07:57             FLIGHT  Has he said anything about the stars yet? Jack?
60:08:00             CAPCOM  No, he hasn't. We can't even ask him a good question. Is he still on FORWARD
                             OMNI?
60:08:05             FLIGHT  FORWARD OMNI, INCO?
60:08:07               INCO  No. AFT OMNI, FLIGHT.
60:08:10               INCO  But you're not going to get through.
60:08:13               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
60:08:14             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:08:15               INCO  They're having trouble grabbing ahold of the S-IVB to push it out of the way,
                             is what the problem is.
60:08:20             FLIGHT  Okay, well, we had COMM before. Can we get back to there?
60:08:22               INCO  That's what they're trying to do. We're not having any luck. There's one
                             suggestion we can do. We can turn the LM transceiver completely off for about 2
                             to 3 minutes, and let them grab ahold of the S-IVB, push it out of the way, and
                             then bring it back up.
60:08:38             FLIGHT  Is that what we have to do now? We can't talk to them to tell them to do that.
60:08:41               INCO  That's right. But if we can get up ?? here, just say: "turn your transceiver
                             off for 3 minutes. Then turn it back on." And I'll try to give you a call if I
                             think you can get through.
60:08:55             FLIGHT  Okay.
60:09:13             FLIGHT  What's the proper terminology over there? On the switch.
60:09:17             CAPCOM  You want the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER?
60:09:17               INCO  TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER to OFF. Panel 12.
60:09:21             FLIGHT  For 3 minutes.
60:09:28             CAPCOM  You want S-BAND XMTR/RCVR OFF?
60:09:30             FLIGHT  Is that our best step here, INCO?
60:09:33             FLIGHT  INCO, FLIGHT. Is that our best step to get COMM back?
60:09:41             FLIGHT  INCO, FLIGHT.
60:09:42               INCO  Go ahead.
60:09:43             FLIGHT  Is that our best step now to get COMM back?
60:09:45               INCO  That's our best step. Right.
60:09:46             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, give them that. We'll try.
60:09:48               INCO  He's not going to hear you, FLIGHT, right now.
60:10:07             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
60:10:08            CONTROL  Go ahead.
60:10:10             FLIGHT  Now, how close are you to having this thing - you're proposing an AGS PTC mode
                             and a -
60:10:15            CONTROL  Well, we just got input - what I'm going to do you - with right now, is a
                             procedure for turning the AGS on and aligning it to the PGNS, so we can turn
                             the PGNS off.
60:10:23             FLIGHT  Yes.
60:10:23            CONTROL  And that'll leave us in an AGS ATTITUDE HOLD mode.
60:10:25             FLIGHT  Yes.
60:10:26            CONTROL  And I just got word from SPAN, the procedure we had for the PTC in AGS, Carlton
                             Hanaway (??) has been, he's - it's not going to work. He's working feverishly
                             to get one that will. Just got that input.
60:10:39            CONTROL  You might be able to handle it without the PTC, saves the attitude that we at -
                             are now at, and then just change attitudes over some time schedule.
60:10:49             FLIGHT  Okay.
60:10:50             CAPCOM  Do you recommend we simulate this procedure over in the LMS before we ship it
                             up?
60:10:56             FLIGHT  Which procedure, Jack? What we're proposing is an AGS ATTITUDE HOLD that we
                             change periodically.
60:11:04             FLIGHT  Since they don't have a PTC, as such, that works.
60:11:06             CAPCOM  Well, that's what I mean -
60:11:08             FLIGHT  Yes.
                     CAPCOM  - we've got a procedure that will give us PTC in AGS, try it in the simulator
                             first.
60:11:12             FLIGHT  They - they don't have a procedure to get a PTC in AGS. They had one -
60:11:16            CONTROL  We had one -
                     FLIGHT  - it doesn't work.
                    CONTROL  - but it doesn't work. Somebody thinks it won't, so we're not going to try it.
                             Unless you want to try that one, there.
60:11:22             CAPCOM  ??
60:11:24            CONTROL  I would say no on that.
60:13:00               INCO  They're trying to bring up an uplink carrier to the LM so we can get them voice
                             down.
60:13:33                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
60:13:34             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:13:35                FDO  I'll bring you up to speed on what I've been doing down here. 
60:13:37             FLIGHT  Say again?
60:13:37                FDO  I'll bring you up to speed on what I've been doing down here. Looking at a
                             maneuver in the vicini - in the present time range, and on the vector that I've
                             got now, looking at about 16 feet per second to get free-return.
60:13:50             FLIGHT  Yeah; that's what I'm hearing over here in my other ear, Bill.
60:13:52                FDO  Alright. And, I've got the selects down here working on a vector right now.
                             This is on the CSM doppler after the glitches.
60:13:59             FLIGHT  Mmhmm.
60:14:00                FDO  And we're not sure whether it's going to be any better than what we've got now.
60:14:04             FLIGHT  Uh huh.
60:14:05                FDO  So, I guess what I've got to say is that in about 10 minutes, I can have a
                             maneuver ready - I'll be able to compute a maneuver; time range of 61:30. And
                             we can make that decision with that - ∆V will be around, like I said, about 16
                             or 17 feet per second.
60:14:20             FLIGHT  And that's a free-return.
60:14:21                FDO  That's affirm. So you can work with that number.
60:14:25             FLIGHT  Thank you.
60:14:28              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
60:14:29             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:14:30              GUIDO  Okay, we've got a good G&N now, if we - probably get a real good burn off now.
                             Go ahead and do it with this good G&N - 
60:14:35             FLIGHT  Uh huh.
                      GUIDO  - get a free-return.
60:15:59             FLIGHT  FDO, FLIGHT.
60:16:00                FDO  Go, FLIGHT.
60:16:01             FLIGHT  Can we - how long would it take you to get a free-return maneuver - could you
                             get one at 61 hours?
60:16:08                FDO  Roger that. I can. It's just a question of which vector we want to do it on,
                             FLIGHT.
60:16:12             FLIGHT  Well, get one at 61 on the best vector you have.
60:16:15                FDO  Roger that.
60:17:15             FLIGHT  EECOM, FLIGHT - TELMU, FLIGHT.
60:17:17              EECOM  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
60:17:18              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
60:17:18             FLIGHT  Merlin, how much water does it cost us to keep the PGNS up for another hour?
60:17:24              TELMU  How much water -
60:17:25             FLIGHT  You got an hourly rate on it?
60:17:28              TELMU  Standby.
60:18:15               INCO  FLIGHT, I think you've got COMM.
60:18:17             FLIGHT  Jack, we have COMM.
60:18:36              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
60:18:37             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:18:37              TELMU  Just about - cost you about 3 pounds of water.
60:18:40             FLIGHT  3 pounds of water to keep it up for another hour.
60:18:42              TELMU  Right.
60:18:42             FLIGHT  Out of how many pounds?
60:18:44              TELMU  About 230.
60:18:47             FLIGHT  That's - seems to me to be worth it.
60:18:49      ?? (off loop)  Yeah, right, I think we gotta keep it up.
60:18:50              TELMU  Okay.
60:18:51      ?? (off loop)  Keep it up through the maneuver and then power it down -
60:18:52             FLIGHT  Yup. Then power it down, let it drift, and we'll do what we want to tomorrow.
60:18:56              TELMU  Okay, but can we go ahead and turn the POWER AMPL off?
60:19:00             FLIGHT  POWER AMPL. What will that do to my COMM?
60:19:02               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
60:19:03             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:19:03               INCO  We lost it again. Standby.
60:19:08             FLIGHT  Gentlemen, we're going to proceed to do a free-return maneuver here. At 61
                             hours, assume that; as soon as we get COMM with the crew we'll see how they
                             feel about doing it there. It's going to be about 16 feet a second, Jack. We
                             want to get on a free-return so we can get powered down. And we'll still kick
                             it at PC+2, if - all - if we can get everything back up and aligned properly.
                             But, with the way it is, we want to get back on free-return; cost us an hour's
                             time here with the PGNS powered up, that's 3 pounds of water and we'll spend
                             that. Okay?
60:19:42             FLIGHT  Now, FDO, get me a PAD, pronto.
60:19:45                FDO  Copy.
60:19:46             FLIGHT  And we'll run a couple of them in case we get behind on time, here. GUIDANCE,
                             what do we need - how do we need to burn this thing? We don't have a vector in
                             there; it's not going to be a guided burn, is it?
60:19:56              GUIDO  FLIGHT, I'm going to MIT run it in a hybrid and see if it can take a vector, if
                             it'll work alright -
60:20:01             FLIGHT  If it can't, how do we do it?
                      GUIDO  - that's what I'm working on right now. If it can't, we'll do it in ATTITUDE
                             HOLD. P47.
60:20:05             FLIGHT  Alright. I think that's the way we want to do it anyway, that mode will get you
                             all that -
60:20:08              GUIDO  Yeah, that's what we know will work right now, I think. But we're going to look
                             at the other.
60:20:27             FLIGHT  INCO, let me know as soon as we get COMM, will you?
60:20:30               INCO  Roger.
60:20:51             FLIGHT  INCO, what do you think my chances are getting COMM back here shortly are?
60:20:56               INCO  Starting to look a little better here, FLIGHT.
60:20:58             FLIGHT  Okay. FDO, you got an estimate on that PAD?
60:21:01                FDO  Say again, FLIGHT?
60:21:01             FLIGHT  You got an estimate on that PAD?
60:21:04                FDO  5 minutes, FLIGHT.
60:21:05             FLIGHT  Thank you.
60:21:08             FLIGHT  And while you're at it, and get - while you get that one out, run a couple more
                             at 15 minute increments. Run one at 60:45, and run one at 61:15, etc. Okay?
60:21:19                FDO  Copy.
60:21:20             FLIGHT  But get the 61 hour one out pronto.
60:21:23                FDO  Roger.
60:21:26             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT. You copying me?
60:21:28            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
60:21:29             FLIGHT  We're going to do a little burn here, 16 feet a second and get back on
                             free-return -
60:21:34            CONTROL  Roger.
                     FLIGHT  - as soon as we can get COMM, we're shooting for 61 hours.
60:21:37            CONTROL  Roger.
60:21:40             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE is doing something to see how the equations are going to work, but I'm
                             inclined to say we ought to do it in ATT HOLD PGNS. Consider that, and consider
                             everything else you want to think about and tell me any changes you'd want to
                             make. And where we ought to pick up the checklist, etc; and let's refer to the
                             - as best we can from the pilot's books, Hal. Tell them where to pick up from
                             where they are now.
60:22:02            CONTROL  Roger.
60:22:42               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
60:22:44             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:22:45               INCO  It looks like you've got it.
60:22:46             FLIGHT  COMM, Jack. Okay, everybody, let's be quiet. We have COMM. We've got a lot of
                             business to do.
60:23:29             FLIGHT  Figure something out.
60:23:38             FLIGHT  After the midcourse.
60:24:15  FLIGHT (off loop)  No, I don't - wait a minute!
60:24:16             FLIGHT  We can give them another 15 minute if - yeah, we can give another - get a
                             suggestion from him. We can figure it out whenever he wants it.
60:24:25             FLIGHT  Get a suggested Tig time from him, Jack, that he's comfortable with. Yeah, it's
                             not going to cost us much water.
60:25:00             FLIGHT  FDO, stand by on a Tig time.
60:25:08             FLIGHT  61:20. Is that okay? 61:25.
60:25:15             CAPCOM  How about 61:30?
60:25:16             FLIGHT  Okay.
60:25:31             FLIGHT  That's right.
60:25:35             FLIGHT  Okay, FDO. You got that Tig?
60:25:41                FDO  Go, FLIGHT. FLIGHT, FDO.
60:25:46            CONTROL  Affirmative.
60:25:46             FLIGHT  Affirmative.
60:25:48             FLIGHT  FDO, you got the Tig time?
60:25:51                FDO  Copy. 61 +30.
60:25:52             FLIGHT  Okay. Proceed.
60:26:40             FLIGHT  Okay.
60:27:14             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, I don't think he ought to do any special maneuvering to find this
                             out right now, do you? Don't talk them into that.
60:27:40             FLIGHT  Okay. Let's concentrate on the burn.
60:28:23             FLIGHT  I didn't hear all of his question. John?
60:28:26             CAPCOM  How much can he use the TTCA?
60:28:31             FLIGHT  FDO, FLIGHT. Have you got tracking on the LM?
60:28:34                FDO  Standby, FLIGHT.
60:28:42                FDO  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
60:28:43             FLIGHT  Okay. Are you seeing anything? He's using his translation controller for
                             attitude control. With the stack. You understand?
60:28:50                FDO  Accurate.
60:28:50             FLIGHT  And now are you seeing that in the trajectory? Have you got a good, solid
                             trajectory?
60:28:55                FDO  I'll check now.
60:29:02             FLIGHT  GNC, FLIGHT - CONTROL, FLIGHT.

60:29:10                GNC  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
60:29:11             FLIGHT  Consider doing a 16 foot-a-second with the Command Module RCS. Service Module
                             RCS - tell me what that means to me.
60:29:19             CAPCOM  FLIGHT.
60:29:20             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:29:20             CAPCOM  Okay, he's wanting us to follow him through on the 2-hour activation. And so I
                             want some people -
60:29:26             FLIGHT  Okay.

60:29:47             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:29:48               INCO  I'd like you to ask him to manage the OMNIs as he's talking.
60:29:52             FLIGHT  Does he have his meter up?
60:29:54               INCO  Yeah, it seems as though he still has that display breaker in, so the meter
                             must be up.
60:29:58             FLIGHT  Okay.
60:29:58               INCO  It appears from my CAL curve that he's up.
60:30:01             CAPCOM  Okay. Let's go. He's gotta hurry to get this 2-hour Activation done in 1 hour.
                             So why don't we -
60:30:07             FLIGHT  Okay, everybody. Quiet in the room, please, and let's walk through with Jack on
                             the Activation. Everybody got their book out, ready to follow. CONTROL, TELMU -
60:30:15            CONTROL  Roger, FLIGHT.
                     FLIGHT  - GUIDANCE. Go, Jack.
60:30:17             CAPCOM  Okay. We're on page 1, step 1. And he's going to be talking back.
60:30:41              TELMU  TELMU. Concur.
60:30:59              TELMU  Concur. Okay.
60:31:12              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
60:31:15             FLIGHT  Go ahead, TELMU.
60:31:17              TELMU  Okay, we do not want to INVERTER 1 CLOSED.
60:31:19             FLIGHT  You what?
60:31:21             FLIGHT  Say again, TELMU?
60:31:22              TELMU  We do not want INVERTER 1 breaker CLOSED in step 5, here.
60:31:25             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, we do not want INVERTER 1 circuit breaker CLOSED in step 5. Do
                             not.
60:31:37              TELMU  And omit step 6.
60:31:38             FLIGHT  And omit step 6.
60:32:16              TELMU  Roger.
60:32:24              TELMU  FLIGHT, we recommend leaving the caution/warning off.
60:32:26             FLIGHT  Caution - recommend that, huh? He says recommend leaving caution and warning
                             off, Jack.
60:32:59              TELMU  We got the time.
60:33:02              TELMU  We got the time, here.
60:33:04             FLIGHT  You got it?
60:33:04              TELMU  We got it.
60:33:12            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
60:33:13             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
60:33:14            CONTROL  Okay, on step 1 did I understand he left the - that he did close ENGINE CONTROL
                             breaker?
60:33:21             FLIGHT  What is your question?
60:33:22            CONTROL  Did he activ - did he close the ENGINE CONTROL breaker under item 1, page 3?
                             Last entry.
60:33:29             FLIGHT  I don't know.
60:33:39              RETRO  FLIGHT, RETRO.
60:33:40               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. We need AFT OMNI.
60:33:53              RETRO  FLIGHT, RETRO.
60:33:54             FLIGHT  Can you wait a minute, RETRO?
60:34:03             FLIGHT  Satisfied, CONTROL?
60:34:04            CONTROL  That's not it, FLIGHT. That's not it.
60:34:10               INCO  AFT OMNI, FLIGHT.
60:34:11             FLIGHT  And we need an AFT OMNI, Jack. We'll lose COMM.
60:34:24            CONTROL  We got it, FLIGHT.
60:34:28             FLIGHT  Okay, CONTROL?
60:34:29            CONTROL  Roger.
60:34:44             CAPCOM  Okay, you want the circuit breaker -
60:34:46             FLIGHT  Okay. Copy these, guys.
60:34:57              TELMU  That's good.
60:35:03            CONTROL  Break, break.
60:35:15             FLIGHT  Okay. Have him standby right there, Jack. What is it, CONTROL?
60:35:17            CONTROL  Okay. On row 1, we need -
60:35:23             FLIGHT  Circle it, and we'll get it at the end.
60:36:43             FLIGHT  Okay, standby, we have a comment. CONTROL, you have a comment.
60:36:45            CONTROL  Yes, on row 1, DECA GIMBAL under AC BUS A needs to be closed.
60:36:51             CAPCOM  Hey, there's a lot of breakers that aren't closed that we have called out in
                             the checklist here. Do you want them to close all of it - outline?
60:37:07            CONTROL  We'll catch the DECA POWER later on.
60:37:11            CONTROL  We'll catch that later.
60:37:12             FLIGHT  We'll remind him of that later.
60:37:13            CONTROL  It's in the procedure.
60:37:15             FLIGHT  It'll come up in the procedure later, Jack.
60:37:22             CAPCOM  How about the rest of these breakers? You want them to close them and open them
                             as outlined in the checklist, here, or you going to have them hold up? Looks
                             like we're going to screw up our procedure here if we don't do it just the way
                             it's outlined.
60:37:36             FLIGHT  I didn't hear you, Jack, I was getting other input.
60:37:37     ??? (off loop)  They're really going to give you a lot of data you don't need - displays and
                             stuff you're not going to get.
60:37:41  CAPCOM (off loop)  You rather -
60:37:44  FLIGHT (off loop)  Yes.
60:37:50  FLIGHT (off loop)  Yes.
60:37:50  CAPCOM (off loop)  - they're supposed to be in that are not now in -
60:37:52  FLIGHT (off loop)  Yes.
          CAPCOM (off loop)  - aren't we going to call those out now?
60:37:53             FLIGHT  TELMU and CONTROL, do you want these that aren't closed to be closed?
60:37:59             FLIGHT  TELMU and CONTROL?
60:38:00              TELMU  No. TELMU.
60:38:03             FLIGHT  Say again?
60:38:04              TELMU  Negative from TELMU.
60:38:06             FLIGHT  CONTROL, how about you?
60:38:07            CONTROL  Negative from us, FLIGHT.
60:38:09             FLIGHT  Well, why are you saying that? Why don't we just do it by the book?
60:38:11            CONTROL  Well - that's the quickest thing in my mind, to do it - just do it by the book.
60:38:15             FLIGHT  Well, why aren't we doing that?
60:38:18            CONTROL  Well. It may take a little more power than what we need - than what we've got
                             to spare.
60:38:24             FLIGHT  Well, I'm willing to spend that right now.
60:38:26            CONTROL  Okay.
60:38:27             CAPCOM  Use the reviewed procedures? We want to -
60:38:28             FLIGHT  Yeah. I think we'd better stick with what we know works.
60:38:31             CAPCOM  - I think we ought to stick to the procedure as-written.
60:38:34             FLIGHT  Yup. I agree, Jack. Let's go ahead.
60:38:36             CAPCOM  You want me to tell them to push them in as -
60:38:39             FLIGHT  As on the list.
                     CAPCOM  - outlined on the checklist.
60:38:40             FLIGHT  Yes. I don't want to take any chances with this.
60:39:19             FLIGHT  Okay, everybody, stick with him now. We're going to be moving on to the next
                             steps.
60:39:26             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT. I want you to have somebody looking ahead. We're going to do
                             this burn in P47. Right?
60:39:32              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE, I don't think we can do it in 47. I don't think we have TVC
                             control in 47.
60:39:38             FLIGHT  What are we going to do it in?
60:39:40              GUIDO  We'll have to do it in 40.
60:39:43             FLIGHT  It doesn't - do we know it works?
60:39:45              GUIDO  We're having MIT run it.
60:39:47             FLIGHT  We have to get them a vector then, up. Do we?
60:39:49              GUIDO  That's affirm.
60:39:51             FLIGHT  I don't really care for that - that's all we can do?
60:39:55              GUIDO  Well, we haven't talked to CONTROL about using the AGS possibly.
60:39:59             FLIGHT  The AGS are not up!
60:40:00            CONTROL  The AGS's not up, and that's strictly a manual operation - that'd be even worse
                             than a 47, probably.
60:40:05             CAPCOM  The procedure as written calls for P40.
60:40:08             FLIGHT  Yeah. The concern, Jack, is that the LM computer, with these funny vectors, we
                             have to verify, see -
60:40:19            CONTROL  Yes.
60:40:22              GUIDO  Leave the RCS TCAs in.
60:40:24             FLIGHT  Yes.
60:40:27             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.
60:40:28              GUIDO  Go, FLIGHT.
60:40:29             FLIGHT  When will the answer come in if it's okay - when are you going to put a vector
                             in, etc?
60:40:38              GUIDO  They're on schedule right now for 61:30?
60:40:41             FLIGHT  Yes.
60:40:42              GUIDO  Okay. We'll - roger. We've got a vector, I think now, that we could go ahead
                             and - but let's standby to get - see if we could get an answer here in the next
                             few minutes. It might be close to there on the hybrid right now.
60:40:54             FLIGHT  Yeah, okay. When am I going to get the answer? Do they know I need it in - you
                             know, 10 or 15 minutes?
60:40:59              GUIDO  Yes, FLIGHT.
60:41:00             FLIGHT  We don't have all night.
60:41:01              GUIDO  They know you need it.
60:41:02             FLIGHT  Alright.
60:41:09             CAPCOM  Okay. And now we can go through this list and see if there are a couple odds
                             and ends we can yank out. Like the tape recorders, he suggests.
60:41:16             FLIGHT  Okay with the tape recorders, TELMU?
60:41:19              TELMU  Roger.
60:41:20             FLIGHT  Yes.
60:41:20             CAPCOM  Any others like that?
60:41:21             FLIGHT  Anything else that's essentially trivial?
60:41:23            CONTROL  We'd recommend opening the RENDEZVOUS RADAR HEATER -
60:41:27              TELMU  They're already opened.
                    CONTROL  - and the LGC. LANDING - excuse me, LANDING RADAR.
60:41:31             FLIGHT  Yeah, that's open too.
60:41:32            CONTROL  Okay.
60:41:33             FLIGHT  All we've got, then, is the recorder, Jack. We agree with that. The others are
                             all okay.
60:41:39             CAPCOM  Okay.
60:42:14             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
60:42:17             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
60:42:18            CONTROL  Go, FLIGHT.
60:42:19             FLIGHT  While you're doing that, could you have somebody work with GUIDANCE on - even
                             without TVC, if we trim this gimbal up right, and don't throttle up for 40 feet
                             a second, we ought to be able to have a pretty good controlled burn.
60:42:35            CONTROL  That's right.
60:42:36             FLIGHT  Work that problem in case thing from MIT comes out negative.
60:42:39            CONTROL  Okay. You talking about doing it in 47?
60:42:41             FLIGHT  Yeah.
60:42:42            CONTROL  Okay.
60:42:46             CAPCOM  How about VHF A and B? We want that left off?
60:42:49               INCO  Off.
60:42:49             FLIGHT  VHF A and B.
60:42:50               INCO  Off.
60:42:50             FLIGHT  Off.
60:42:51             CAPCOM  OPEN?
60:42:52               INCO  OPEN, yes.
60:42:53             FLIGHT  OPEN.
60:43:05               INCO  Negative.
60:43:05             FLIGHT  Negative.
60:43:20               INCO  When we need it - when we want it we'll tell him.
60:43:21             FLIGHT  Leave it OPEN; we'll call for it when we want it.
60:44:18             FLIGHT  PROCEDURES, FLIGHT.
60:44:20         PROCEDURES  Go ahead.
60:44:20             FLIGHT  61:30.
60:44:22         PROCEDURES  Roger that. Thank you.
60:44:23             FLIGHT  You're squeaking.
60:44:27             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT, they're going back over the panel, are they? Okay.
60:44:33             FLIGHT  CONTROL, TELMU, and GUIDANCE, and INCO.
60:44:34            CONTROL  CONTROL here.
60:44:35             FLIGHT  Look ahead a little bit, now, in this thing, and anticipate what you want to be
                             deleted.
60:44:41              GUIDO  Roger.
60:44:50            CONTROL  Negative. Not - negative on the PQGS. Standby.
60:44:53             FLIGHT  Negative on the PQGS. We're checking the REGs.
60:45:04            CONTROL  And negative on the ASCENT HELIUM REGs.
60:45:06             FLIGHT  And how about the SYSTEM ENGINEER X-POINTER?
60:45:09            CONTROL  X-POINTER negative.
60:45:10             FLIGHT  X-POINTER negative.
60:45:25              TELMU  Roger.
60:45:39              TELMU  Negative.
60:45:39             FLIGHT  TELMU, you said no, didn't you?
60:45:40              TELMU  Negative.
60:45:41             FLIGHT  Negative.
60:45:51             FLIGHT  FAO, let me how we're doing on time, will you? How are we doing?
60:45:56                FAO  Roger, FLIGHT, we will. Standby.
60:46:00             FLIGHT  I want you to monitor us here, and see that we're on time.
60:46:02                FAO  Roger.
60:46:14             FLIGHT  CONTROL, no AGS, right?
60:46:15            CONTROL  No AGS.
60:46:16             FLIGHT  No AGS.
60:46:19            CONTROL  We need the ATCA breaker, but no AGS.
60:46:27             FLIGHT  FDO, FLIGHT.
60:46:28                FDO  Go, FLIGHT.
60:46:29             FLIGHT  Now run one for 61:45.
60:46:31                FDO  Copy.
60:46:42            CONTROL  It's for the gimbals, FLIGHT.
60:46:45            CONTROL  Negative.
60:46:49             FLIGHT  ATCA AGS? Is that what he said?
60:46:51            CONTROL  Affirmative.
60:46:52             FLIGHT  Okay.
60:46:52            CONTROL  He's only reading out the ones he's leaving open, is that right?
60:46:57             CAPCOM  That's affirmative. The ones that are black in the checklist, which he is
                             deviating, he is calling out.
60:47:03            CONTROL  Yeah. Okay. I assume the other ones he didn't mention are closed, if they are
                             blacked in.
60:47:08             FLIGHT  Yes. By the book.
60:47:16              TELMU  No. Close that one.
60:47:18             FLIGHT  You want that one closed?
60:47:19              TELMU  Yeah. It doesn't pull any current.
60:47:20             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, want that closed, it doesn't take any current.
60:47:37             FLIGHT  Yeah.
60:48:02             FLIGHT  INCO?
60:48:03               INCO  Roger.
60:48:04             FLIGHT  INCO?
60:48:04               INCO  Which circuit breaker is he talking about?
60:48:06             FLIGHT  He said can we leave the steerable off, and operate off the OMNIs?
60:48:09               INCO  That's true. We want the heater circuit breaker left in, though.
60:48:14             FLIGHT  Okay. Are you listening to the loop?
60:48:15               INCO  Yes.
60:48:16             FLIGHT  Yeah, we want the heater circuit breaker in, but we'll stick with the OMNIs.
60:48:18               INCO  Right.
60:48:19             FLIGHT  CAPCOM.
60:48:47              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
60:48:48             FLIGHT  Go.
60:48:48              GUIDO  Okay, we've got a - our LOAD's ready to go, here, FLIGHT. We want to load a
                             vector and external ∆V.
60:48:54             FLIGHT  Okay. Have the loads been verified, yet? Is this the same vector that's being
                             run on a hybrid?
60:49:00              GUIDO  Close to it, FLIGHT. Essentially the same thing.
60:49:03             FLIGHT  You're sure of that?
60:49:04              GUIDO  Roger.
60:49:05             FLIGHT  Alright.
60:49:09             FLIGHT  And when they run it and say it's okay, we can assume it is? Is that right?
60:49:12              GUIDO  That's affirm, FLIGHT.
60:49:13             FLIGHT  Alright. Is it the same vector we would have used for this DPS +2 - LI +2
                             hours, or is it a different one?
60:49:21              GUIDO  Well, it's FDO's present vector, FLIGHT. The only problem that we're worried
                             about is the integration problem on board -
60:49:26             FLIGHT  Yeah. Mmhmm.
60:49:26              GUIDO  Okay -
60:49:26             FLIGHT  And the scaling, and all that business.
60:49:29              GUIDO  Yeah, but the vector doesn't really matter all that much what vector it is.
60:49:38              GUIDO  This is - this is essentially one. We need to load this, though. Even if we do
                             a P47 -
60:49:43             FLIGHT  Okay.
                      GUIDO  - we need to load this vector.
60:49:49              TELMU  Negative.
60:49:51             FLIGHT  Say again, TELMU? Negative?
60:49:51              TELMU  Negative.
60:49:52             FLIGHT  Negative?
60:49:56             FLIGHT  And, CAPCOM, if we get P00 and DATA, we will put a state vector and target LOAD
                             in for him.
60:50:18             FLIGHT  Yes.
60:50:22             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, you should have it.
60:50:23              GUIDO  Okay, FLIGHT. We'll have to wait until they get the uplink configured. INCO's
                             working on it.
60:50:32             FLIGHT  ORDEAL?
60:50:33            CONTROL  Negative. You don't need it.
60:50:34             FLIGHT  Negative.
60:50:43              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
60:50:44             FLIGHT  Go.
60:50:45              TELMU  Before we burn here, we should deploy the landing gear so that we don't get any
                             control problems.
60:50:50             FLIGHT  Does that come up somewhere in the procedure?
60:50:53            CONTROL  It comes up, FLIGHT.
60:50:54             FLIGHT  Say again?

60:52:46             FLIGHT  INCO, do you have the OMNI for the burn attitude?
60:52:48              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE, we're in the middle of a LOAD right now.
60:52:51             FLIGHT  Oh. Okay. CAP - what do you mean? You don't want them to maneuver?
60:52:54              GUIDO  That's right. Let's hold it.
60:52:56             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, could he hold his maneuver until we finish the LOAD, please?
60:53:14            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
60:53:15             FLIGHT  Go.
60:53:16            CONTROL  MIT recommendation for the maneuver to attitude is to use the TTCA rather than
                             the auto-maneuver. Hand controller.
60:53:24             FLIGHT  Okay. He's been doing that. We'll give it to him.

61:06:28             FLIGHT  CONTROL?
61:06:29            CONTROL  Do that and stop.
61:06:32            CONTROL  Go to AUTO and then stop, we'll take a look at it.
61:06:34             FLIGHT  Go to AUTO and then what?
61:06:35            CONTROL  And then stop. That's the question he asked. So he just wants to go to AUTO and
                             then take a look at it.
61:06:39             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:06:41             FLIGHT  And then he gets the thruster firing, and then what?
61:06:43            CONTROL  Okay, you see it - watch it settle down, and then - and then we proceed on to
                             test.

61:06:50             FLIGHT  Got it, Jack?
61:06:57             FLIGHT  Will they stabilize with the docked configuration all right?
61:07:01            CONTROL  It should, FLIGHT. We've got the DAP set up, FLIGHT.
61:07:04             FLIGHT  Okay. Okay, let's watch it.

61:07:45              GUIDO  Negative. We haven't received it yet, FLIGHT.
61:07:47             FLIGHT  What's your estimate on it? We need it for the burn.
61:07:49              GUIDO  We're getting it right now, FLIGHT.
61:07:52             CAPCOM  Okay, you watch his loading?

                             32021, that was not correct on the DAP. He's got our old DAP mode in right now,
                             he didn't put that in.
61:08:54             FLIGHT  What do you want us to do?
61:08:55            CONTROL  He should go per the checklist, 32021.

61:09:19            CONTROL  He can do that after he gets through the test, no problem.
61:09:22             FLIGHT  Well, okay, but it's there for some reason.
61:09:30             FLIGHT  FAO, how are we doing on time?
61:09:32                FAO  FLIGHT, we are sitting alright. The only other thing we've got left is the DPS
                             press. And -
61:09:39             FLIGHT  And then we go into the 6 minute?

61:09:57            CONTROL  And we're driving.
61:10:01             CAPCOM  Okay, and one other point that's brought out here, we've got a 4-jet ullage
                             loaded in the DAP, and we've got 2 in the PAD.
61:10:09             FLIGHT  CONTROL?
61:10:10            CONTROL  That's right, FLIGHT.
61:10:11             FLIGHT  What do you want us to do?
61:10:13            CONTROL  Standby on that.
61:10:27            CONTROL  Okay, to get - to make it agree with the PAD, the DAP load would be changed to
                             be 31021.
61:10:32             FLIGHT  Well. Do you want to - why don't we just leave it the way it is?
61:10:36            CONTROL  As far as I'm concerned we can leave it the way it is.
61:10:37             FLIGHT  RETRO, FDO, you copy that?
61:10:39              RETRO  Say again, FLIGHT?
61:10:40             FLIGHT  You copy that? We're going to do a 4-jet. That's what we've got loaded. That

61:10:47             FLIGHT  Yeah. CAPCOM, mention that to him so he doesn't think of it later and get
                             confused. We're going with the 4-jet, vice the 2-jet on the PAD.
61:10:55             CAPCOM  Okay. Are we seeing his gimbal go where it's supposed to?
61:10:57            CONTROL  Yes. It's over against the stop and coming back now.

61:12:06             FLIGHT  How close were they?
61:12:07            CONTROL  We're within about 0.3. We're - from the -

61:12:17            CONTROL  It is off.
61:12:17             FLIGHT  Okay. Everything else is okay? Steps 3, 4, 5, and 6?

61:13:51            CONTROL  Looks fine.
61:14:06             FLIGHT  Okay, everybody. We are holding at about the 6 minute point in the checklist.
61:14:09             CAPCOM  Okay, at the bottom of page 15, we've got a new DAP. We've got 31021. You want
                             that in there?
61:14:14            CONTROL  That's what put us in a 2-jet boot, FLIGHT. That will put us in 2-jet system
                             boot for the ullage.
61:14:19             FLIGHT  Okay. But -
61:14:21            CONTROL  Just leave it alone.
61:14:22             FLIGHT  Yeah. We'll leave it where it is, Jack.
61:14:24            CONTROL  Roger.
61:14:24             FLIGHT  We told him 4 jets, that's what he's got.
61:14:26             CAPCOM  Roger.
61:14:27             FLIGHT  And we - we - has he passed page 15?
61:14:30     AFD (off loop)  Yeah. He's right here -
61:14:30             FLIGHT  He's on 16 now, right? Yeah, he's into it. GUIDANCE, FLIGHT -
61:14:35              GUIDO  Go, FLIGHT.
                     FLIGHT  - I'm waiting for that GO.
61:14:36              GUIDO  We watched his P30 here, it looks good.
61:14:38             FLIGHT  Yeah, I know. But have you got somebody talking to MIT?
61:14:41              GUIDO  They're still talking to them, haven't got an estimate yet.
61:14:43             FLIGHT  Well, we have 15 minutes to the burn.
61:14:46             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:14:47            CONTROL  Go.
61:14:47             FLIGHT  How do I do this burn if I get a NO GO on - DAP control?
61:14:53            CONTROL  Okay, standby 1, I'll give you a rundown on that, FLIGHT, put my thoughts
                             together.
61:14:56             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:14:57              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
61:14:58             FLIGHT  Go.
61:14:59              GUIDO  I'd recommend going ahead and doing this burn if we don't hear from MIT. They
                             feel it'll work, without the run.
61:15:11              GUIDO  Everybody feels that it will work.
61:15:16             FLIGHT  Okay, well what do we do during it if it looks funny, is my question?
61:15:23              GUIDO  During the burn?
61:15:24             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:15:42             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:15:43            CONTROL  Go ahead.
61:15:45             FLIGHT  PGN - okay, you want to do a PGNS AUTO or TTCA?
61:15:48            CONTROL  TTCA, FLIGHT.
61:15:49             FLIGHT  TTCA, CAPCOM. We recommend TTCA to the attitude.
61:15:56             FLIGHT  With a TTCA.
61:16:04             FLIGHT  INCO, what's our OMNI for this burn attitude?
61:16:08               INCO  FORWARD.
61:16:10             FLIGHT  Does he have it on there now?
61:16:10               INCO  He's there now.
61:16:11             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:16:14             CAPCOM  That attitude doesn't look like what I've got on the PAD, here.
61:16:23             CAPCOM  FLIGHT?
61:16:24             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:16:24             CAPCOM  You like that attitude?
61:16:25             FLIGHT  I'm looking at it. Standby.
61:16:33             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT. You copying that?
61:16:36              GUIDO  What's on the ball right now?
61:16:39             FLIGHT  What angles are you looking at, CAPCOM? You looking at the ball angles?
61:16:43             CAPCOM  I'm looking at all of them. I'm looking at what he's got on the 50 18 on the
                             DSKY, and also what he's got on the FCDUs -
61:16:51              GUIDO  FLIGHT, the pitch and roll look great. The yaw - the only reason it looks
                             different is just because he's sitting there right now.
61:16:58             FLIGHT  Sitting where?
61:17:01              GUIDO  With the attitude he's at presently. The pitch and yaw - and roll are correct.
61:17:07             FLIGHT  Yeah. On the DSKY. Is that right?
61:17:10              GUIDO  Right.
61:17:11             FLIGHT  Yeah. The FDAI is different.
61:17:14              GUIDO  FLIGHT, we're looking at the FCDUs and they're correct.
61:17:16             FLIGHT  Mmhmm. How about yaw? That's the one that's out yet? And is he moving in that
                             axis?
61:17:21              GUIDO  Yaw doesn't matter, FLIGHT, that's about the thrust vector. That's just where
                             he happens to be.
61:17:25             CAPCOM  Okay, are we ready -
61:17:25              GUIDO  It's not constrained - it's not constrained in yaw.
                     CAPCOM  - for him to maneuver in the attitude we gave him in the -
61:17:28             FLIGHT  Yup.
61:17:29             FLIGHT  Do you want him to go to a particular yaw?
61:17:33             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE?
61:17:34              GUIDO  Negative, FLIGHT.
61:17:36             FLIGHT  We okay on the OMNI? That we're on?
61:17:44             FLIGHT  INCO, we okay on this OMNI?
61:17:45               INCO  Yes. The OMNI they're on will be good.
61:17:47             FLIGHT  Okay. GUIDANCE and CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:17:49              GUIDO  Go ahead.
61:17:49            CONTROL  Go, FLIGHT.
61:17:50             FLIGHT  I still have a question as to what you want me to do if somehow or other
                             something turns up in the guidance during this burn.
61:17:56              GUIDO  Okay, I have a recommendation, FLIGHT.
61:17:58             FLIGHT  And it is?
61:17:59              GUIDO  Okay, with tur - setting up the burn, we would turn the ENGINE GIMBAL switch to
                             OFF, we'd go to PGNS ATT HOLD, MIN IMPULSE on the - on the -
61:18:09             FLIGHT  Wait a minute. ENGINE GIMBAL - this - wait a minute. We're in the burn, and
                             this is what you -
61:18:13              GUIDO  Oh. This is during the burn you're talking about?
61:18:14             FLIGHT  Well -
61:18:15              GUIDO  Okay.
61:18:15             FLIGHT  That's when this started. What do you want me to do for -
61:18:17              GUIDO  Okay. If he's in the burn, they'd go ENGINE GIMBAL off and just use the TTCA to
                             hold attitude. And then as he can, to turn the MODE CONTROL switch to ATT HOLD.
61:18:33             FLIGHT  MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD.
61:18:35              GUIDO  Roger.
61:18:44             FLIGHT  In that order?
61:18:46              GUIDO  Yeah. ENGINE GIMBAL off, MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD, and utilize the TTCA.
61:18:52             FLIGHT  Okay. So you changed the order.
61:18:55              GUIDO  Well, this MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD, he can do that - he should do that as soon
                             as he can, but that - the most important thing is he get attitude control, and
                             he has to do that with the TTCA. So it'll probably be a simultaneous thing.
61:19:06             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:19:06             CAPCOM  Okay, FLIGHT. Now, you verify his attitude?
61:19:09             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE? You verify his attitude is okay?
61:19:15              GUIDO  He's not at attitude yet, FLIGHT.
61:19:17             FLIGHT  Is he moving?
61:19:18              GUIDO  Roger. He is moving. When he gets there, he'll be in good shape.
61:19:21             FLIGHT  Is there any way we can check this now, is there a star out of his window or
                             anything?
61:19:25              GUIDO  We're running this - right now, we're running to see if there is a star
                             available at the attitude he's maneuvering to.
61:19:30             FLIGHT  Alright. Hurry up.
61:19:31              GUIDO  There wasn't at the other atti - previous one that we had.
61:19:34             FLIGHT  Alright.
61:19:35              GUIDO  But he's at a different - going to a different yaw, so we're checking it.
61:20:23                FAO  FLIGHT, FAO.
61:20:24             FLIGHT  Go.
61:20:26                FAO  If we don't get to attitude soon, we're going to be running behind here.
61:20:31             FLIGHT  Okay. How far away are we?
61:20:34                FAO  I'm in the same boat as -
61:20:36             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, what are the DP - IMU attitudes that are on the DSKY that we're
                             looking for?
61:20:41             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE?
61:20:42              GUIDO  The IMU?
61:20:45             FLIGHT  What attitude will you read on the DSKY when he's in-attitude?
61:20:50             FLIGHT  CDU.
61:20:50              GUIDO  15.7 is yaw. Pitch is 178.1, and roll is 4.47.
61:20:59             FLIGHT  How far away is he?
61:21:00              GUIDO  He's just about there. He's right there now, FLIGHT.
61:21:05             CAPCOM  We got any physical reference he can use?
61:21:07             FLIGHT  Okay. Have you seen any star yet?
61:21:12             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:21:14             CAPCOM  Verify the attitude?
61:21:16             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, you like the attitude?
61:21:18              GUIDO  Looks good, FLIGHT. The attitude looks good.
61:21:26             FLIGHT  Sun is out the forward window. That pretty much obscures a star.
61:21:35             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.
61:21:36              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
61:21:37             FLIGHT  Have you got anything on confirming the attitude?
61:21:40              GUIDO  Negative, FLIGHT. The only star available is star 86, there.
61:21:47              GUIDO  FLIGHT, MIT will not have a run on this thing.
61:21:50             FLIGHT  Okay, now - but it is the judgement that it is okay to use?
61:21:53              GUIDO  Roger.
61:21:55             FLIGHT  It is. Alright.
61:21:56              GUIDO  It's the judgement of the software people it's GO - it's good.
61:22:00              GUIDO  That it'll be alright.
61:22:12   GUIDO (off loop)  That's right.
61:22:18            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
61:22:19             FLIGHT  Go.
61:22:20            CONTROL  Okay. Could we possibly look ahead here and get some of these done so it
                             doesn't get too crowded right by the start of the burn? There's a couple of
                             items that need to be taken care of.
61:22:27             FLIGHT  Like what?
61:22:28            CONTROL  Well, we need to get THROTTLE CONTROL to MANUAL; he's in AUTO right now. It's
                             over right - in the 4 minute segment. And we need to get VERB 65 in.
61:22:38             FLIGHT  Okay, what's the matter with him going through the nominal checklist?
61:22:41            CONTROL  Okay.
61:22:41             FLIGHT  He's in attitude, we're at the 6-minute point -
61:22:42            CONTROL  Okay. Very good.
                     FLIGHT  - that's comfortable. I don't want to change anything, Hal.
61:22:45            CONTROL  Okay.
61:23:08             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
61:23:12             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, FLIGHT.
61:23:13             CAPCOM  Go.
61:23:13             FLIGHT  Jack, your opinion: think it would be worth reviewing that if he sees any kind
                             of rates or anything to go ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL ATT CONTROL -
                             ATTITUDE HOLD, and TTCA? You think it's worth reviewing with him?
61:23:27             FLIGHT  To finish the burn?
61:23:33             CAPCOM  I don't think it would hurt it to talk it over with him.
61:23:35             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:23:42              GUIDO  That's affirm.
61:23:43             FLIGHT  Affirmative.
61:23:53              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU.
61:23:54             FLIGHT  Go.
61:23:55              TELMU  For your information, our water rate's dropped down a little in our favor.
61:23:59             FLIGHT  Thank you.
61:24:02             CAPCOM  FLIGHT? CAPCOM.
61:24:05  FLIGHT (off loop)  Yeah, I just mentioned it to him.
61:24:07             FLIGHT  Who's calling?
61:24:08             CAPCOM  CAPCOM's calling -
61:24:08             FLIGHT  Yeah.
                     CAPCOM  - I noticed on page 17, MANUAL THROTTLE -
61:24:23             FLIGHT  CONTROL?
61:24:25            CONTROL  Standby 1, FLIGHT.
61:24:26             FLIGHT  Top of page 18.
61:24:32             CAPCOM  He's right.
61:24:33            CONTROL  Negative, FLIGHT.
61:24:34             FLIGHT  No need for that, Jack.
61:24:41            CONTROL  FLIGHT, while he's going through that, you might flag him on page 17 -
61:24:44             FLIGHT  Yes?
                    CONTROL  - THROTTLE CONTROL AUTO should be THROTTLE CONTROL MANUAL.
61:24:48             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:24:49            CONTROL  And you can delete PQGS turned on at the bottom.
61:24:51             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, you got that? THROTTLE CONTROL in the middle of that stuff at 4
                             minutes -
61:25:00              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
61:25:01             FLIGHT  How much - how much you want ullage?
61:25:04            CONTROL  We can just let it go ahead and start ullage automatically now, FLIGHT.
61:25:06             FLIGHT  We'll let it go automatically, Jack.
61:25:07              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
61:25:08             FLIGHT  Go.
61:25:08              GUIDO  He needs to go ahead and hit ENTER on his program and proceed on the P40.
61:25:13             FLIGHT  Okay. He needs to do an ENTER and proceed on, CAPCOM.
61:25:17              GUIDO  There's still time yet, FLIGHT. Just a minute.
61:25:21              GUIDO  Oh, he did it, FLIGHT. Standby.
61:25:37             FLIGHT  And propellant quantity down at the bottom, don't worry about it. It's not on.
61:25:40             CAPCOM  No big deal.
61:25:41             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:25:48             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, would you read them up that takeover?
61:25:51             FLIGHT  If you have it, there. Here it is if you don't.
61:26:01            CONTROL  ENTER, FLIGHT.
61:26:02             FLIGHT  You ready to ENTER?
61:26:03            CONTROL  Right. Do an ENTER.
61:26:04             FLIGHT  ENTER.
61:26:08             CAPCOM  He said, "what is it?"
61:26:14             FLIGHT  What did he say?
61:26:18             CAPCOM  He said, "what is it?"
61:26:19             FLIGHT  What is it, GUIDANCE?
61:26:20              GUIDO  It's for AUTO THROTTLE, FLIGHT.
61:26:22             FLIGHT  It's for AUTO THROTTLE. That doesn't say much to me, GUIDANCE, but -
61:26:29             FLIGHT  We burn MANUAL, you know, GUIDANCE.
61:26:30              GUIDO  He's gotta manual-throttle the thing, FLIGHT.
61:26:31             FLIGHT  Yes.
61:26:33            CONTROL  He needs to put his throttle to MIN, also, FLIGHT.
61:26:38             FLIGHT  Throttle to MIN.
61:26:39            CONTROL  Yes. He's at 29% now, roughly.
61:26:42             FLIGHT  Okay. CAPCOM, he needs to put his -
61:26:43            CONTROL  Standby, disregard that.
61:26:44             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:26:44            CONTROL  I can't tell; he hasn't armed the DPS yet, but he needs to confirm that he does
                             have it at MIN.
61:26:49             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:27:12             FLIGHT  Won't that - CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:27:14             FLIGHT  ATTITUDE HOLD and TTCA, won't that fight itself?
61:27:17            CONTROL  Negative. He's in MIN IMPULSE, FLIGHT. He goes ATT HOLD, it turns the jets off.
61:27:20             FLIGHT  Alright.
61:27:29             CAPCOM  Okay. How are you set up for 2 minutes?
61:27:32             FLIGHT  What's that Tig counting down to, GUIDANCE, the ullage?
61:27:37              GUIDO  Negative, FLIGHT. Engine ignition.
61:27:40             FLIGHT  Okay. What is - why is our clock counting a different number up there?
61:27:44              GUIDO  Time delay, FLIGHT, from -
61:27:45             FLIGHT  That's an awful big one.
                      GUIDO  - you're reading his DSKY.
61:27:48             FLIGHT  Plus, he's ahead of us.
61:27:55              RETRO  FLIGHT, RETRO. I've got an ignition time of 1:47. 1:45.
61:28:00             FLIGHT  Is he loaded correctly?
61:28:07             FLIGHT  Say again? GUIDANCE or RETRO? Is he loaded correctly?
61:28:11             FLIGHT  That's the question.
61:28:12      ?? (off loop)  The Tig is right.
61:28:12              GUIDO  Tig is right, FLIGHT.
61:28:13             FLIGHT  On board. Thank you.
61:28:16              GUIDO  Wall clock is wrong, FLIGHT.
61:28:17             FLIGHT  Thank you.
61:28:23             CAPCOM  Okay, how do you like his configuration at 1 +30?
61:28:25             FLIGHT  CONTROL, everything okay with you?
61:28:27            CONTROL  We haven't seen the VERB 65, but that's okay if he doesn't get it.
61:28:32             FLIGHT  You satisfied with the throttle, or is he not armed yet?
61:28:34            CONTROL  He's not armed yet, FLIGHT.
61:28:36             FLIGHT  Alright.
61:28:40             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, okay?
61:28:41              GUIDO  We're good, FLIGHT.
61:28:42             FLIGHT  CONTROL. Okay?
61:28:43            CONTROL  We're okay, FLIGHT.

61:29:13            CONTROL  Still on VERB 65, FLIGHT.
61:29:16             FLIGHT  Do you want to tell them?
61:29:18            CONTROL  Yes. Tell him we need ENGINE ARM. He's got it. We're at low throttle point.
61:29:23             FLIGHT  We need a VERB 65 ENTER.
61:29:24            CONTROL  - -
61:29:25             FLIGHT  Is that what you're telling me, CONTROL?
61:29:26            CONTROL  Disregard.
61:29:27             FLIGHT  Thank you.
61:29:40            CONTROL  We have ullage.
61:29:50            CONTROL  We have ignition, low throttle point.
61:29:56            CONTROL  40 percent.
61:29:57            CONTROL  Rates look good.
61:29:58             FLIGHT  Rates are holding good, huh?.
61:30:01            CONTROL  Looking okay, FLIGHT.
61:30:02             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:30:16            CONTROL  Still looking good.
61:30:22            CONTROL  Shutdown.
61:30:23             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:30:26             CAPCOM  Okay, how about what's left over?
61:30:30             FLIGHT  Any requirement to trim?
61:30:33              GUIDO  - - trim, FLIGHT.
61:30:34             FLIGHT  Trim to what?
61:30:36              GUIDO  0.2.
61:30:38             FLIGHT  Well. Kind of hard to do that.
61:30:42             FLIGHT  That's good, isn't it?
61:30:44              GUIDO  That's good enough.
61:30:44             FLIGHT  Good, CAPCOM.
61:30:58             FLIGHT  Yes.
61:31:05              TELMU  FLIGHT, TELMU. He should - MASTER ARM OFF.
61:31:07            CONTROL  And he can go back to MIN IMPULSE when he desires, FLIGHT.
61:31:10             FLIGHT  Okay. Well now, he's got to go through a number of things, right?
61:31:12            CONTROL  Roger.
61:31:21             FLIGHT  Okay, CONTROL. The next question is what control mode, if any, do you want to
                             be in, here? Work with the back room. Do we want to try to set up some kind of
                             PTC in AGS or are we just going to power down, let this thing drift?
61:31:31            CONTROL  Okay. Let me pull my thoughts together for a minute, Glynn.
61:31:34             FLIGHT  Yeah. Okay, but you have somebody work that -
61:31:36            CONTROL  Yes. Roger.
                     FLIGHT  - I want you to watch to configuration, here.
61:32:02               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
61:32:03             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:32:03               INCO  You got a minute to talk?
61:32:05             FLIGHT  Just a minute.
61:32:05               INCO  Okay.
61:32:06            CONTROL  FLIGHT, from CONTROL.
61:32:09             FLIGHT  How are we doing? Are we getting configured MASTER ARM?
61:32:11              TELMU  No. We've still got the MASTER ARM ON.
61:32:13             FLIGHT  Yeah, you'd better have them take the MASTER ARM OFF. CONTROL, anything for
                             configuration?
61:32:17            CONTROL  The only thing I might recommend, if he wants to - the VERB 76 but I'm happy
                             with the way it is right now.
61:32:23             FLIGHT  Okay. We're going to turn the PGNS down here, pronto.
61:32:26            CONTROL  Yeah, we've got to get the AGS turned up, though - and I've got the procedure
                             here to give -
61:32:29             FLIGHT  Well, now, do we? Have to get it turned up?
61:32:34            CONTROL  Standby.
61:32:36             FLIGHT  How about just drifting?
61:32:37            CONTROL  If that's -
61:32:38             FLIGHT  Well, that's what I'm asking you to check.
61:32:40            CONTROL  Yeah, okay. But let's not turn the PGNS off right quick-like. Let me check for
                             you.
61:32:52             FLIGHT  That's what we're going through right now.
61:33:04               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
61:33:05             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:33:06               INCO  If you're going to do something with powering down, you'd better do it quick,
                             because I'm going to have to make you do a handover here, and it's probably
                             going to cost you COMM for at least 5 minutes.
61:33:14             FLIGHT  How soon? Are you going to have to hand over?
61:33:16               INCO  Well, the handover's going to have to go on here in about - 12, 13 minutes.
61:33:20             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:33:21               INCO  And we want to turn off the receiver - transceiver for 5 minutes up here.
61:34:00             FLIGHT  FDO, FLIGHT.
61:34:01                FDO  Go, FLIGHT.
61:34:02             FLIGHT  Do you have any requirement for the PGNS anymore?
61:34:05                FDO  Negative.
61:34:05             FLIGHT  I'm not turning it down now. Look - - - go ahead.
61:34:10                FDO  Go ahead.
61:34:11             FLIGHT  The current situation is - is that we're checking about the PTC. We had - do we
                             have an AGS procedure for setting up a PTC in AGS, now? CONTROL? That people
                             think might work?
61:34:23             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:34:24            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
61:34:25             FLIGHT  Do we now have a procedure that people think might work in AGS?
61:34:27            CONTROL  Negative. Do not.
61:34:28             FLIGHT  We don't have a procedure?
61:34:30            CONTROL  Not right now. In AGS, for PTC.
61:34:35             FLIGHT  Well. It all rapidly gets academic, then, huh?
61:34:40            CONTROL  That's right.
61:34:44            CONTROL  Standby 1, FLIGHT.
61:34:46             FLIGHT  Jim's checking to see what he wants to tell us about PTC -
61:34:48            CONTROL  We're getting input from SPAN, it looks like no issue here - there's no PTC
                             required.
61:34:52             FLIGHT  Okay, well, we'll wait and see in a minute. If that's so, there's no need in
                             powering the AGS up.
61:34:56            CONTROL  That's right.
61:34:57             FLIGHT  We're waiting for them.
61:35:02             FLIGHT  Okay, and if that's the case, then we'll go ahead down. The only reason I'm
                             delaying powering the PGNS down is to be sure we don't need the AGS. It sounds
                             like we don't know how to use it anyway, but I - give them 2 minutes and we
                             ought to know for sure.
61:35:13            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
61:35:14             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:35:15            CONTROL  As I understand it, we're doing another burn at roughly 79 hours?
61:35:17             FLIGHT  Say again?
61:35:18            CONTROL  Are we doing another burn at 79 hours?
61:35:20             FLIGHT  Plan on that. Yes. I don't know whether we are or not -
61:35:22            CONTROL  How are we going to get alignment?
61:35:24             FLIGHT  Plan on that.
61:35:29             FLIGHT  Can you turn off the thrusters -
61:35:31            CONTROL  Affirmative, then he can go MODE CONTROL OFF, whatever he desires.
61:35:35            CONTROL  Stand - standby on that, FLIGHT. Standby on that.
61:35:37             FLIGHT  He asked if he could turn off the thrusters.
61:35:38            CONTROL  Standby on that. One moment, FLIGHT.
61:35:42            CONTROL  FLIGHT, from CONTROL.
61:35:43             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:35:43            CONTROL  The reason I ask: if we turn everything down now, and then do another burn at
                             79 hours, how are we going to get alignment?
61:35:48             FLIGHT  Yeah, I know. I know.
61:35:54  FLIGHT (off loop)  When is that?
61:35:56             FLIGHT  FAO, when is the shadow of the Moon that we might get a P51 and 2?
61:36:00                FAO  Okay, FLIGHT. Standby and we'll look at that.
61:36:04             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT. How much does it cost me to keep the AGS up, as a coarse
                             reference?
61:36:10              TELMU  That's going to cost -
61:36:10             FLIGHT  How many pounds of water? And how many amps?
61:36:14             FLIGHT  Say again? Ed?
61:36:55            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
61:36:57             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:36:58            CONTROL  Some items that we can actually pull right now and save some power that they
                             don't need is the ATCA breaker, and the DECA GIMBAL and the DECA breaker.
61:37:05             FLIGHT  Now wait a minute. We don't want to be out of attitude control, do we?
61:37:08            CONTROL  That won't - I won't put you out of attitude control.
61:37:13             FLIGHT  Okay. That's right. That's the -
61:37:14            CONTROL  If you - if you want to save some power right now. We may have to put them back
                             in later when we go to AGS, but -
61:37:21             FLIGHT  Okay, which ones were they?
61:37:22            CONTROL  The ATCA on CB 16, and the DECA GIMBAL and DECA POWER.
61:37:32             FLIGHT  Yeah. We can sure turn those off.
61:37:33            CONTROL  Roger. I suggest we do that.
61:37:36             FLIGHT  Let's start with the DECA ones, huh?
61:37:38            CONTROL  Okay.
61:37:39             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, while we're going through this subject, two items for power
                             conversation would be the DECA GIMBAL and POWER circuit breakers on panel - 16?
                             11.
61:37:50            CONTROL  11 for the DECA GIMBAL and DECA POWER. ATCA is on panel 16.
61:37:57             FLIGHT  What control now do I have if I turn off the ATCA (PGNS) circuit breaker?
61:38:02            CONTROL  Not ATCA (PGNS). Just ATCA.
61:38:03             FLIGHT  Oh, okay. The ATCA on panel 16, huh?
61:38:07            CONTROL  Roger.
61:38:08             FLIGHT  Okay. There are a couple of power items.
61:38:10  CAPCOM (off loop)  Yes.
61:38:10             FLIGHT  While we're figuring out what to do.
61:38:11            CONTROL  Right.
61:38:31                 ??  Y'all, one thing you can do -
61:38:49            CONTROL  Okay. We confirm they're open, FLIGHT.
61:39:00                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
61:39:21             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, FLIGHT.
61:39:23             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE -
61:39:23              GUIDO  Go, FLIGHT.
61:39:24             FLIGHT  Can you give us star - ball angles, I should say, for a COAS star check in the
                             shadow?
61:39:35              GUIDO  Yeah.
61:39:35             FLIGHT  Pronto.
61:39:37              GUIDO  In the Moon shadow?
61:39:38             FLIGHT  No. No, in the shadow of the vehicles. Looking away from the Sun.
61:39:53             FLIGHT  GUIDANCE, can you get one of those in a hurry? That would give us a check on
                             the reference before we do something with it.
61:40:00             CAPCOM  How about - how about the idea he just gave us about using the Command Module
                             optics in manual? To find stars?
61:40:07             FLIGHT  Well, we can do that now - what's our objective here, to check the platform
                             again?
61:40:17             FLIGHT  I mean, we can do a lot of things. I want to know why we want to do something.
61:40:39               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
61:40:40             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:40:40               INCO  Okay, look, I'm running out of time.
61:40:42             FLIGHT  Yeah. I know.
61:40:43               INCO  Well, we've got to do a handover here. We don't have any choice. To try to make
                             it as quick as possible, I want to turn down the transceiver for 5 minutes, let
                             us push the IU out of the way, and then bring up the carrier after 5 minutes,
                             when it comes on we'll be able to distinguish the LM. That's the quickest way
                             we know how to try to do it. And we hope it works better than last time.
61:41:07             FLIGHT  Okay. Well you gotta hand over now, do you?
61:41:08               INCO  We don't have any choice. It's going to be one way or another - it's either
                             going to be the hard way or the easy way. I can't guarantee either way.
61:41:15             FLIGHT  Okay. I wish I knew what we wanted to do, here, before we lost COMM.
61:41:20            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
61:41:22             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:41:23            CONTROL  I've got a recommendation.
61:41:24             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:41:41             FLIGHT  EECOM? We gave him a GO on that, didn't we? He probably didn't hear it. Hook up
                             the side hatch urine dump.
61:41:46              EECOM  Has he got - has he got it hooked up now?
61:41:48             FLIGHT  We don't know. He was -
61:41:49              EECOM  If he hadn't -
61:41:53             FLIGHT  Oh, you don't want to?
61:41:58             FLIGHT  What do you want him to use?
61:42:01              EECOM  Use the normal procedure. Let - - let me explain that.
61:42:06               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO. I've got a degree left. That's it.
61:42:08             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, we're going to have a loss of COMM here while we switch stations. Let
                             them know that, will you?
61:42:13               INCO  FLIGHT, that's not what I want to do. I want him to turn the transceiver OFF
                             for 5 minutes.
61:42:17             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:42:21             FLIGHT  CAPCOM, have him turn off the S-BAND transmitter/receiver.
61:42:25               INCO  5 minutes.
61:42:25             FLIGHT  5 minutes.
61:42:27            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
61:42:29             FLIGHT  Can you wait, CONTROL?
61:42:29            CONTROL  Roger.
61:42:36             FLIGHT  He has to turn off the S-BAND transmitter for 5 minutes while we do a site
                             handover with this COMM situation.
61:42:41               INCO  Transceiver.
61:42:57                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
61:42:58             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:42:59                FDO  Okay, confirmed burn shows -
61:43:01             FLIGHT  - - FDO, stand by a minute.
61:43:02                FDO  Roger.
61:43:03             FLIGHT  Unless you've got a problem.
61:43:04                FDO  No problem.
61:43:15               INCO  That's affirmative.
61:43:30             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:43:31            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
61:43:45            CONTROL  Affirmative.
61:43:50            CONTROL  That's good enough. That's real good.
61:43:50             CAPCOM  You ready for the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER?
61:43:53             FLIGHT  You ready for that? They're ready.
61:43:55               INCO  GO.
61:43:55             CAPCOM  On - turn it off now?
61:43:56               INCO  Roger.
61:43:56             FLIGHT  Go ahead, for 5 minutes.
61:44:07               INCO  He doesn't have to touch the POWER AMPL. Just the TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER, and
                             he'd better hurry.
61:44:44             FLIGHT  They want to get some kind of roll attitude going if possible. CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:44:48            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
61:44:49             FLIGHT  Can you figure out if we point the thing north, can you give us a mode in the
                             AGS that we can set up a low roll rate?
61:44:57            CONTROL  Yeah, we can come up with one, FLIGHT.
61:44:59             FLIGHT  Could I have - could I ask for a little quiet in the room, please? It's getting
                             awful noisy in here.
61:45:05            CONTROL  We can work on that, but I've got something in my mind here, that I think we
                             ought to do first.
61:45:08             FLIGHT  Okay. And that is?
61:45:09            CONTROL  And that is to bring the PGNS - bring the AGS up, take the PGNS alignment to
                             it, turn that PGNS off.
61:45:14             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:45:16            CONTROL  We're eating power.
61:45:16             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:45:18            CONTROL  We can do that now.
61:45:19             FLIGHT  Okay. As soon as we get the COMM.
61:45:21            CONTROL  And I've got the procedure for doing it.
61:45:22             FLIGHT  Bring it over, please.
61:48:29             FLIGHT  FAO, FLIGHT.
61:48:31                FAO  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
61:48:32             FLIGHT  When are we going to have the timing that we're in the Moon shadow?
61:48:36                FAO  I'm trying to find out from FDO now, when he's going back to reference with it,
                             FLIGHT.
61:48:40             FLIGHT  Okay. Pronto, okay? As soon as you can?
61:48:43                FAO  Roger.
61:48:44                FDO  FLIGHT, FDO.
61:48:45             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:48:46                FDO  Would you like some post-burn data?
61:48:49             FLIGHT  Yes.
61:48:50                FDO  Okay. Closest approach 136.75.
61:48:54             FLIGHT  That's based on the confirmed maneuver?
61:48:56                FDO  That's affirm.
61:48:57             FLIGHT  From the PGNS.
61:48:58                FDO  That's affirm.
61:49:00                FDO  We've got a gamut entry interface of -6.53.
61:49:05             FLIGHT  Okay. I'm - with - that's all coming out nominal, then.
61:49:08                FDO  Roger. What's even better is that the doppler is within 7 cycles.
61:49:14             FLIGHT  So you think the doppler confirms it.
61:49:16                FDO  The doppler says that we're - we did the right things, that's affirm.
61:49:18             FLIGHT  Alright.
61:49:55             FLIGHT  FDO and FAO, when are you going to have the time for me when we're behind the
                             Moon?
61:50:58               INCO  Hold on a second now, Jack.
61:51:00             FLIGHT  - - you're on the loop, Ed.
61:51:16             FLIGHT  What's the conclusion? We can keep the IMU up?
61:51:27             FLIGHT  And we've got the water?
61:51:32      ?? (off loop)  Well, we may have to turn off some other things.
61:51:50             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
61:51:51              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
61:51:52             FLIGHT  Are you guys coming together with what's being discussed up here for a
                             recommendation - I'm being told that we could conceivably leave the IMU up in
                             the LM - turn the LGC, I guess, OFF right now, leave the IMU up, and power down
                             post-PC+2 DPS burn.
61:52:12             FLIGHT  Are you involved in all that?
61:52:13              TELMU  Yeah. I have to leave the total load, there, of course. We've been kind of
                             involved with the EPS concern.
61:52:19             FLIGHT  Bill Peters has been in - Bill, would you, quick, tag in now -
61:52:22         Gold TELMU  Okay.
                     FLIGHT  - I'd like, quickly, to know what you want done.
61:52:41               INCO  FLIGHT, INCO.
61:52:42             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:52:43               INCO  Have at it.
61:53:51             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT - gentlemen, it's getting noisy in the room.
61:53:54              TELMU  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
61:53:55             FLIGHT  Let's keep down the conversations.
61:54:09            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
61:54:12             FLIGHT  Okay. Go ahead. Calling, FLIGHT.
61:54:14            CONTROL  One - CONTROL. One thing to consider, Glynn, is if we do this, we're going to
                             have to have - implement a method of keeping them out of gimbal lock.
61:54:23             FLIGHT  I guess they're just going to have to watch it.
61:54:24            CONTROL  He's got nothing to watch on board. We're powering everything down.
61:54:27             FLIGHT  No, we're going to leave the IMU up.
61:54:29            CONTROL  Okay. Got to leave the inverters up, then.
61:54:32             FLIGHT  Okay, well that's what I'm waiting for TELMU to tell me.
61:54:35             CAPCOM  We need a DAP load to conserve RCS.
61:54:39             FLIGHT  A DAP load to conserve RCS, CONTROL.
61:54:43            CONTROL  Okay. He wants it right now?
61:54:46             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:54:47             CAPCOM  Right now.
61:55:02            CONTROL  FLIGHT, CONTROL.
61:55:03             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:55:04            CONTROL  Recommend he goes VERB 76 MIN IMPULSE, and then keep his eye on the middle
                             gimbal angle.
61:55:09             FLIGHT  Okay. Is that all you've got to tell them for the DAP?
61:55:10            CONTROL  Yeah, the DAP load's okay. But he needs to go MIN IMPULSE.
61:55:15             FLIGHT  Okay.
61:55:15            CONTROL  VERB 76. And keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle.
61:55:20             FLIGHT  TELMU, FLIGHT.
61:55:21              TELMU  Go, FLIGHT.
61:55:22             FLIGHT  I guess I kind of need to know, here, as much as you do -
61:55:26              TELMU  Roger.
                     FLIGHT  - if we're okay to leave the IMU up and we can swing it. Then I'd just as soon
                             do that.
61:55:31              TELMU  Yeah. I think that's the way it's looking right now.
61:55:33             FLIGHT  Okay, how long will it take you to conclude that?
61:55:37              TELMU  Just a couple more minutes.
61:55:58             CAPCOM  Do we have a PAD for 79 hours?
61:56:01             FLIGHT  Not yet, I'm sure.
61:56:21             FLIGHT  Okay, gentlemen. The proposal before the room right now is to turn down the LGC
                             and to pick up all the rest of the smaller power items we can. Leave the IMU
                             up; TELMU's within a few minutes of -
61:56:31              TELMU  Yeah.
                     FLIGHT  - coming in on that subject.
61:56:33              TELMU  We can - we can do that, FLIGHT, with the IMU up and the AC. It looks like it
                             would probably -
61:56:38             FLIGHT  The AC. You mean one ball. Okay. Is that what you mean?
61:56:41              TELMU  Yeah. Inverters. Yeah. Looks like also it would probably be cheaper,
                             power-wise, to turn the steerable on, if we could get COMMs attention here -
                             INCO.
61:56:50             FLIGHT  INCO, you up?
61:56:51               INCO  Yes.
61:56:52              TELMU  Turn the steerable up, since we've got the AC anyway, and power down the POWER
                             AMPL.
61:56:58             FLIGHT  Is that cheaper?
61:56:59              TELMU  It's cheaper power-wise.
61:57:00             FLIGHT  INCO, is that okay with you?
61:57:02               INCO  We'll give it a try.
61:57:04             FLIGHT  That gives us kind of - spotty coverage, doesn't it?
61:57:07               INCO  We're going to have to get into a different attitude.
61:57:09             FLIGHT  We're going to have to roll.
61:57:11               INCO  That's right. We're going to have to get out of the attitude we're in.
61:57:14             FLIGHT  Can you do it on the high-gain, or - you can't switch OMNIs anyway.
61:57:18             FLIGHT  Well, we've got a guy awake.
61:57:19               INCO  He'll have to do it for us.
61:57:20             FLIGHT  We've got a guy awake anyway.
61:57:23             FLIGHT  Well -
61:57:26             FLIGHT  Will we get high-gain coverage, and then we'll drop off, is that what'll happen?
61:57:29               INCO  Yeah, it'll go at the end of blockage or gimbal limits and he'll have to switch
                             to an OMNI.
61:57:33             FLIGHT  Recommend something to me, will you? How many amps do we save?
61:57:37              TELMU  FLIGHT, we just save about an amp and a half, so it's not a -
61:57:40             FLIGHT  And it's not a - it's not a coolant item. It's not a water item, is it?
61:57:42              TELMU  Yeah.
61:57:43             FLIGHT  Alright, I'm - let's let that go for tonight anyway. Maybe we'll figure
                             something clever out tomorrow night.
61:57:47              TELMU  Okay, FLIGHT.
61:57:49             FLIGHT  Okay, TELMU. Have you concluded on this LGC?
61:57:54              TELMU  We're going to leave the IMU up, right?
61:57:55             FLIGHT  Yeah, but the computer you want to go down? If we want that, let's get on with
                             it.
61:57:59             FLIGHT  CONTROL, FLIGHT.
61:58:00            CONTROL  Go ahead, FLIGHT.
61:58:01             FLIGHT  You ready? You and TELMU, are you together there -
61:58:04            CONTROL  Yeah, I'm trying to get - get my ducks in a row with him right now, FLIGHT.
                             Standby.
61:58:08              GUIDO  FLIGHT, GUIDANCE.
61:58:09             FLIGHT  Go ahead.
61:58:10              GUIDO  You asked a while ago about some stars. I've got some - I picked out some stars
                             to look - if you - I don't know if he wants to do any maneuvering - the
                             maneuver, it's 180 degrees from the Sun. To center the COAS.
61:58:22             FLIGHT  Okay. Well, standby with it.
61:58:47            CONTROL  FLIGHT, from CONTROL.
61:58:48             FLIGHT  Yeah.
61:58:49            CONTROL  Did we just tell him to power the computer down?
61:58:51             FLIGHT  No, we're just advising on what the plan's going to be.
61:58:52            CONTROL  Oh, okay.
61:58:53             FLIGHT  But we're waiting.
61:58:54            CONTROL  Yeah, okay.
61:59:56             FLIGHT  TELMU and CONTROL, have you got there yet?
61:59:59              TELMU  Roger, FLIGHT.
62:00:00            CONTROL  Roger, FLIGHT.
62:00:01             FLIGHT  You're GO to power the LGC down?
62:00:01            CONTROL  Right.
62:00:02              TELMU  Yeah. LGC and IMU.
62:00:03             FLIGHT  What do you want to do? Pull the circuit breakers?
62:00:05              TELMU  Standby.
62:00:06             FLIGHT  Did you give me something on it?
62:00:07              TELMU  I think Bob Carlton did, didn't you, Bob?
62:00:09            CONTROL  You said power down or power up?
62:00:11             FLIGHT  Down.
62:00:13            CONTROL  Oh.
62:00:16             FLIGHT  CONTROL?
62:00:17            CONTROL  Yeah.
62:00:17             FLIGHT  I'm talking - we're going to leave the IMU up, then. Are you ready to proceed
                             and power the computer down?
62:00:22            CONTROL  Negative! I do not want to power the computer down.
62:00:24             FLIGHT  Now why not?
62:00:26            CONTROL  I'm being told that we can leave it up for the sleep period and it will keep
                             their attitude for them, keep them out of gimbal lock.
62:00:33             FLIGHT  The computer also?
62:00:34            CONTROL  Yes. That's what I've been told. The LGC.
62:00:42             FLIGHT  Okay. So you'd tell them to leave the computer up also, huh?
62:00:45            CONTROL  Affirmative.
62:00:45             FLIGHT  And that's okay on the profile?
62:00:47              TELMU  That's affirmative.
62:00:49              TELMU  It's about 22 amps total.
62:00:51             FLIGHT  And what kind of control mode do you see them being in, here tonight?
62:00:54            CONTROL  Okay, just in a 5 degree deadband ATTITUDE HOLD.
62:00:59             FLIGHT  Wait a minute. We don't want to be in ATTITUDE HOLD. We want to roll - oh, you
                             want to let roll go?
62:01:03            CONTROL  You can't let roll go. It's going to be an ATT HOLD.
62:01:07             FLIGHT  Okay, but - Hal, can we fly ATT HOLD the whole time? We're going to burn
                             something up!
62:01:13            CONTROL  I've got the question in, I haven't got an answer on it yet, FLIGHT.
62:01:18            CONTROL  The tentative answer I got was we did not require any PTC.
62:01:25            CONTROL  Yeah, the only problem, Glynn, if - in the other mode, if we just leave the
                             platform up, we may drift through gimbal lock and that would defeat the purpose
                             of leaving it up.
62:01:33             FLIGHT  We have a guy sitting there watching it! We're going to keep a guy up!
62:01:38            CONTROL  Okay. And we're going to have to leave the inverters on also, then.
62:01:40             FLIGHT  Yeah!
62:01:40            CONTROL  Okay.
62:01:41             FLIGHT  That's - that was what I thought you were talking about!
62:01:43            CONTROL  Negative. I was out of step with you, FLIGHT. Sorry.
62:01:46             FLIGHT  And we'll set up a roll manually, and we'll let them watch it and we'll do the
                             best we can like we did for Apollo 8.
62:01:49            CONTROL  Okay. If he does it that way, he'll have to use hard-over command on the ACA to
                             stop any perturbations, then.
62:01:57            CONTROL  ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL breaker has to be in. Yes, use hard over on the ACA.
